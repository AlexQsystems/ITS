### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,  In establishing a Nevada revocable trust, it is not mandatory to have a Nevada-based trustee. The eStatePlanTM Revocable Living Trust will define Nevada as the trust's legal situs regardless of the location of the grantor or the successor trustee. This legal framework supports the trust's adherence to Nevada's favorable trust laws without necessitating a Nevada resident trustee.  For administration and settlement ease, considering a Nevada-based trust company is advisable. This strategic partnership can simplify the process significantly. However, it's perfectly acceptable for a family member or friend to serve as trustee, regardless of their location.  I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** Can I establish a Nevada trust regardless of where I live?
- **Answer:** Yes. Any U.S. citizen in any of the 50 states may establish a Nevada trust. In fact, even foreigners with domestic assets may establish a Nevada trust that will provide asset protection and wealth preservation benefits.

- **Question:** Why Nevada Trust Law is Premium
- **Answer:** Trust administration law in the State of Nevada is codified primarily in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) / Chapter 163 of Trusts. Under Nevada jurisdiction, for example, under the guidance of an eStatePlanTM "Certification of Trust," Nevada law directs successor trustees in an enumerated fashion that only a trust beneficiary can get a complete accounting from the trustee of the trust's terms after the death of the trust's grantor. This avoids a lot of challenges from non-beneficiaries who are otherwise not vested parties of the trust. Nevada trust law has been influenced by the body of trust law from several influential states including Alaska, Delaware, South Dakota, and Missouri. This influence has elevated many Nevada trust advantages to the forefront. Nevadatrust law has adopted additional bodies of law that place it at the premium level. Significant advantages include: * Nevada's law of situs – particularly regarding asset protection and wealth preservation * 365-year Dynasty Trust – the nation's longest * Directed Trust options for investment advisors * Elimination of the rule against perpetuities * Statutory validation of trusts settled without grantor awareness * Allowing decanting/merger of old trusts into modern, more efficient trust instruments * Liberal doctrine regarding interpretation of the grantor's intent.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,      No, a Nevada-based trustee is not strictly required to establish a Nevada revocable trust. Any U.S. citizen may establish a Nevada trust, regardless of where they live. This includes non-residents and foreigners with domestic assets. However, having a Nevada-based trustee can provide advantages for estate settlement purposes.     The critical element is that The eStatePlan™ Revocable Living Trust will define Nevada as the trust's legal situs, allowing for the application of Nevada's favorable trust laws, regardless of the grantor's or successor trustee's location.     While family members or friends can serve as successor trustees irrespective of their residency, ITS recommends - for estate settlement purposes - appointing a Nevada trust company strategically partnered with them to serve as Trust Protector and/or Trust Settlement Officer during transition times.     I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

Good morning,  A Nevada-based trustee is not required to establish a Nevada revocable trust.

Good afternoon,

The setup of the trustee portion of the password is the responsibility of the Client/User. They must keep their password secure and ensure they have the necessary credentials, such as the Client Console ID# and Trustee Password. If assistance is needed, contacting the office is recommended.

Each child can have their own individual password for accessing their accounts. It's important to securely manage these passwords, adhering to the required minimum length and character diversity. Users are responsible for keeping these passwords safe.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

Good afternoon,

The trustee password should be set up by you (the client/user). It is your responsibility to keep this password secure, as password security ultimately rests on your personal choice. While the system requires a minimum password length and variety, ensure it's managed properly as it cannot be recovered by the system.

Each trustee, including both your son and daughter, will require their own unique Trustee Password to access the Client Console. If you do not have the Trustee Password for either trustee, please contact the office for assistance. They can also manage their access via the Trustee Login portal.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

The trustee password is typically set by the client or the trust's setup process. If you do not have the Trustee Password, you should contact the relevant office for assistance in obtaining this information.

Each trustee has their own credentials to access the Client Console, which includes their unique Client ID# and Trustee Password.

Good afternoon,

A paid cemetery plot can indeed be considered a real property asset. In legal terms, the requirements for a valid realty deed include a grantor, grantee, writing, delivery, and acceptance, which extends to cemetery plots. It is advisable to ensure that such assets are correctly recorded and acknowledged to affirm their status as real property assets within your estate planning.

Recordation, for legal/validity purposes, is unnecessary; its effect is [only] to give constructive notice and determine priorities. (12 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2010) Real Property, § 254; Cal. Civ. Code, §1217.) Unrecorded deeds are valid as between the parties and as to all those who have (been given) notice thereof. (Cal. Civ. Code, § 1217, supra; Merritt v. Rey (1930) 104 Cal. App. 700, 707 [citing Blackledge v. McIntosh, (1927) 85 Cal. App. 475, 483.].) Note: These cases provide additional examples of why the MLCP asset-assignment process precludes the requirement of creating and recording formal realty deeds of transfer (until after the decease of the grantor/trustee). The doctrine of asset assignability is also recognized by the federal government in numerous Private Letter Rulings and the Internal Revenue Code. An example is recorded in IRC §408(e)(4), which allows for the pledging, by assignment, of a retirement (IRA) account as security for a loan. (See also CCA 2006-44020). The ASSET SCHEDULE helps to clearly establish the transfer intent of all assets listed, including personal real estate interests, equity accounts, and all other personal property. When properly filled out, there can be no legal uncertainty as to the lawful application of the Funding Kit Ledger/Schedule.

- **Question:** Sole & Separate Property Ownership
- **Answer:** In the Estate of Heggstad case, a California Court of Appeals ruled that a separate, formal realty deed was not necessary to affect a transfer of realty property to a trust where the grantor was currently serving as trustee. The court stated: “It is well established that if two specific requirements are met, real property may be made part of a trust's assets WITHOUT (emphasis added) a separate deed transferring property to the trust. The first requirement is that the owner of real property is the settlor creating the trust with himself or herself (serving) as the trustee. Second, because a conveyance of real property is at issue, the other requirement for transferring real property to a trust is compliance with the statute of frauds. Accordingly, a written declaration of trust by the owner of real property, in which he names himself as trustee, is sufficient to create a trust in that property (i.e. without the use of a formal realty deed to affect the transfer)."

Good afternoon,

Yes, a cemetery plot that has been paid for is generally considered a real property asset. It can be included in the estate planning process and may avoid probate if assigned to a trust. Courts have ruled that formal deeds are not always necessary to effectuate such transfers, focusing instead on compliance with the law regarding property transfers and asset assignability. Please ensure proper documentation is maintained to clearly establish the intent of the transfer in estate matters.

The court stated: “It is well established that if two specific requirements are met, real property may be made part of a trust's assets WITHOUT (emphasis added) a separate deed transferring property to the trust. The first requirement is that the owner of real property is the settlor creating the trust with himself or herself (serving) as the trustee. Second, because a conveyance of real property is at issue, the other requirement for transferring real property to a trust is compliance with the statute of frauds. Accordingly, a written declaration of trust by the owner of real property, in which he names himself as trustee, is sufficient to create a trust in that property (i.e. without the use of a formal realty deed to affect the transfer)."

- **Question:** Acquiring Title to Non-Realty Assets
- **Answer:** The Uniform Trust Code promulgates, and Nevada statutory law recognizes, the legality of assigning assets to trusts with an asset- assignment ledger technique including with the use of lawfully-recognized electronic signatures to implement the same. Therefore, after you have presented the ESIGNed “Account Assets Transfer to Trust” page (on the “ESIGN for Assets Transfer” button) to the transfer agents accompanied with the appropriate documentation prescribed earlier including the Master Signatory Guarantor pages (if implemented), the transfer agents will then have the properly referenced/documented legal authority to now retitle the trust assets to you as the (successor) trustee of the trust

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

A paid cemetery plot can be considered a real property asset, as it may be included in the assets assigned to a trust. In cases like the Estate of Heggstad, real property does not require a separate deed to be transferred to a trust if the trust creator is the property owner. Therefore, a cemetery plot may be treated as real property for estate planning and asset assignment. It's important to ensure proper documentation if the plot needs to be assigned to a trust for probate avoidance.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** ASSET-ASSIGNMENT FUNDING OVERVIEW
- **Answer:** A realty deed is essentially a realty-transfer affidavit. The only requirements for a valid realty deed (affidavit of transfer) are (i) a grantor, (ii) a grantee, (iii) a writing/subscription, (iv) the delivery, and (v) an acceptance. Recordation, for legal/validity purposes, is unnecessary; its effect is [only] to give constructive notice and determine priorities. (12 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2010) Real Property, § 254; Cal. Civ. Code, §1217.) Unrecorded deeds are valid as between the parties and as to all those who have (been given) notice thereof. (Cal. Civ. Code, § 1217, supra; Merritt v. Rey (1930) 104 Cal. App. 700, 707 [citing Blackledge v. McIntosh, (1927) 85 Cal. App. 475, 483.].) Note: These cases provide additional examples of why the MLCP asset-assignment process precludes the requirement of creating and recording formal realty deeds of transfer (until after the decease of the grantor/trustee). The doctrine of asset assignability is also recognized by the federal government in numerous Private Letter Rulings and the Internal Revenue Code. An example is recorded in IRC §408(e)(4), which allows for the pledging, by assignment, of a retirement (IRA) account as security for a loan. (See also CCA 2006-44020). The ASSET SCHEDULE helps to clearly establish the transfer intent of all assets listed, including personal real estate interests, equity accounts, and all other personal property. When properly filled out, there can be no legal uncertainty as to the lawful application of the Funding Kit Ledger/Schedule. For trust estate settlement purposes, account vendors/agents (etc.) will be under established legal requirements to accept the validity of the recorded events that assigned your assets to your trust.

- **Question:** Sole & Separate Property Ownership
- **Answer:** Spouses frequently may have assets that have been either (i) procured/earned before marriage, or (ii) received as a gift, or (iii) inherited. Such are deemed as sole & separate property and do not have to be commingled as jointly owned property with the other spouse. Moreover, the spouse/owner can maintain continual lifetime control of the separate property including who he or she may wish to benefit from it as a lifetime gift, or as an inheritance from the owner's will (probate), or as a beneficiary of the owner's trust. In this illustration, Mr. Whiteacre inherited lake property from his parents' estate years ago. He maintained the lake property as his sole & separate asset, which (as mentioned) any married person in any state receiving inherited property is allowed to do. Since Mr. Whiteacre used the MLCP Funding Kit to previously assign his sole & separately-held lake property to their Whiteacre Family Trust, it will avoid probate when being ultimately transferred to the trust beneficiaries. It should be mentioned here that Mrs. Whiteacre will need to record Mr. Whiteacre's Death Certificate and the Assignment of Realty Transfers (and the Affidavit of Identity) in the County Recorder office where the lake property is located so that she, as the current trustee of the Whiteacre Family Trust, may take over control of the property, so as to pay its property taxes & maintenance costs, and to "occupy" the property.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

The Scheduled Auto Debit Charge by ITS Alliance will continue until you cancel your MLCP Membership in the Client Console, it expires due to failed debit, or a NotePad request by the Successor Trustee terminates the payments. An active membership isn't necessary after a member's decease, as the Successor Trustee can still access the Client Console to view and print but not modify the information.

You may be charged for various reasons related to your asset management, particularly if it involves a Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT). These may include the costs associated with transferring assets into the trust, administering the trust, or dealing with legal requirements such as signing an Affidavit of Solvency upon initial transfer, which certifies that the transferor is solvent and not making a fraudulent transfer. For specific details about your charges, please review your agreement or contact customer service.

The retrieved context does not specify the exact charge amount. For information regarding charges, please reach out to a human for assistance.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** The Domestic Asset Protection Trust
- **Answer:** Prior to the groundbreaking body of law – concerning self-settled spendthrift trusts – written primarily by Jonathan Blattmachr and later enacted by the State of Alaska in 1997, off-shore trusts were essentially the only option available for one to transfer personal assets away from one’s own name and full control into a special trust in order to remove those assets from being a resource to satisfy a potential legal claim all while maintaining a measurable benefit from those assets. That attractive arrangement was essentially what was being offered with off-shore planning mechanisms, and it became a well-known option for certain wealthy Americans. But the introduction of the domestic asset protection trust (DAPT) in 1997 changed the landscape. In fact, as of this writing, nineteen other states (a total of twenty) have enacted similar self-settled spendthrift trust law. So there is now a more affordable (and perhaps feasible) option available to many US citizens of “having one’s cake and eating it too” with the onset of the DAPT. However, not all DAPTs are equal. In fact, only those states with historic, previously favorable “pro-trust” laws have occupied the top ratings. In my view, and in the view of many others, Nevada stands at the very top. The remainder of this chapter will be about domestic asset protection law with the use of trusts. And because of Nevada’s stature in the field, it will be in particular about Nevada’s statutory asset protection trust law. Notice in the writing that I refer to the Nevada Asset Protection Trust (NAPT) as the Nevada Wealth Preservation Trust (NWPT), which we have trademarked in our company.

- **Question:** What Actually is a Transfer Tax?
- **Answer:** We start with an interesting fact. If you are a taxpayer with assets, the federal government (and most state governments) have a literal split-interest claim over every dollar you transfer whether during lifetime or upon your decease. Transfers made by the taxpayer/asset-owner during his lifetime are deemed as gifts and therefore subject to the federal “gift tax” table. Transfers made upon the taxpayer’s death are deemed as distributions from his estate and therefore subject to federal “estate tax” table. Both gift tax and estate tax are statutorily bundled and are ultimately imposed as a federal transfer tax. There is also an applied graduated scale to the federal transfer tax table, which currently starts at the 18% level and increases to 40%. And, conversely, there is an exemption available against the transfer tax. The exemption amounts have significantly increased over the years. As of this writing, the current maximum exemption amount is $12.92 million for a single transferor and $25.84 million for a married couple. If federal transfer tax obligations are still owed after the entire transfer tax credit has been applied, then a large estate is obviously involved. And the maximum (40%) taxable rate will be applied against any transfers exceeding the federal exemption equivalent amount.

- **Question:** Locating all assets assigned to the Trust
- **Answer:** If the grantor has assigned personal REALTY INTERESTS to the trust (i.e., to the trustee), such would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button (and the Spouse’s ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button – with a co-grantor trust). If the grantor has assigned NON-REALTY ASSETS to the trust, such would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Assets Transfer” button. If the grantor has intended to assign ASSETS PAYABLE to the trust, such assignments would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Assets Payable” button. Bring up the respective ESIGNed asset-transfer pages in order to print and for delivery to a transfer agent, or you may show the agent ONLINE through the Trustee Login portal. However, beneficiary-designation changes for insurance policies and other payable-in-death contracts are normally required to have been made at the institutional-vendor level, by the grantor, to affect the change. If that beneficiary (re)designation was not accomplished during the grantor’s lifetime, you can still present the ESIGN for Assets Payable” Ledger to the vendor institution. Depending on the governing contract, the vendor may otherwise accept the deceased grantor’s intent.

Good afternoon,

The Scheduled Auto Debit Charge by ITS Alliance to your credit card will occur as part of the MLCP Membership Subscription. Auto-payments are processed until you cancel your membership in the Client Console, until a charge fails, or upon a request from the Successor Trustee to terminate payments. It’s important to note that an active membership is not necessary after a death, allowing the Successor Trustee to still access the console for viewing and printing purposes.

Please check your account statements or billing history for charges that may relate to services, fees, or subscriptions associated with your account. If you believe these charges are incorrect or unexpected, I encourage you to reach out to customer support for clarification and assistance with your billing queries.

For details on the Scheduled Auto Debit Charge, please note that auto-payments continue until the membership is cancelled, it expires due to failed debit, or upon a request from the Successor Trustee to terminate payments. There wasn't specific pricing information retrieved, so further details on the cost may need clarification from the relevant sources.

- **Question:** General vs. Special Power of Appointment
- **Answer:** As a rule, a decedent holding a special power of appointment over property (at the time of his death) will not have the value of that property in his estate for estate tax purposes. A special power of appointment held by a grantor of an irrevocable grantor trust (irrevocable for transfer purposes, or to change beneficiaries, or to change trustees without just cause) will cause the corpus of the trust to be in his/her estate for estate tax purposes and thus be stepped-up to the current value at the date of donor's death. The reason is that there was no completed gift at the time of transfer because the donor retained the right to change beneficiaries, etc. On the other hand, if the beneficiaries could not be changed, then the transfer would have been deemed a completed gift and, as a consequence, the original basis would be retained with no step-up.

- **Answer:** The dynamics of The eStatePlanTM processing platform are made possible through bundled software applications that auto-merge both field and custom text entries unto certain software-selected document templates. The templated documents can be further tailored with data-entry-driven replacement/removal code. And IT IS FAST. * The data entries for The eStatePlan creation are made ONLINE as a turn-key, client controlled (howbeit, office-assisted) system complete with electronic signature (ESIGN) applications to implement the Dynamic Trust Portfolio document set and the electronic Funding Kit. * The eStatePlan's bundled platform applications empower the client/user within a secure environment to generate a personalized, fully-funded and properly implemented Revocable Living Trust estate plan in about an hour! * The eStatePlan system also provides comprehensive “Custom Trust Directives” that can be imported by the user, and/or the assisting attorney-of-record, 4 through the ONLINE Data Entry page. The result is a customized, Revocable Living Trust Estate Planning document set electronically generated when the Data Entry page is submitted, which can be modified within the Client Console. The eStatePlan user dynamics and benefits are available only through a password protected, subscription-based Client Console. The Console serves as the dashboard tool that enables The eStatePlan user to electronically implement, manage, store, and modify (without limitation) his estate plan in a web-based, secure cloud environment. The eStatePlan Client Console also features a “Share Console” functionality where the user can “share” any selected portion of the data in the Client Console to anyone including his legal counsel through an ancillary, password protected code. This allows the user’s legal counsel (personal attorney) to review the user’s data and trust draft, and make any changes that counsel deems necessary to obtain the estate planning goals of the client/user. The eStatePlan processing system equips client/purchasers to not only electronically create but also to modify without limitation (24/7) their personalized estate planning packages in a secure, user-friendly environment – The eStatePlan Client Console – if the user opts for and maintains the My LifeCard Plan (MLCP) Membership Subscription beyond the 90-day, provisional term.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

The Scheduled Auto Debit Charge by ITS Alliance will continue to occur until one of the following happens: you cancel your MLCP Membership inside the Client Console, it expires due to a failed debit, or a NotePad request by the Successor Trustee terminates the payments. To manage your debit information, you can visit your Membership Status and follow the prompts to update your payment method. Please ensure your membership remains active to prevent any interruptions in services.

You may be charged due to the establishment of a Domestic Asset Protection Trust (DAPT) or a similar trust, which allows for the removal of personal assets from being available to satisfy potential legal claims while still retaining benefits from those assets. The DAPT was introduced to provide a more affordable way for many U.S. citizens to protect their wealth while maintaining control over it. Other factors, such as specific statutory provisions applicable to your trust, could also contribute to the charges.

The specifics about the charge amount are not provided in the retrieved context. For precise information regarding the charges, please reach out to a human for further assistance.

I hope this information is helpful! Please let me know if you need any additional assistance. Have a great day!

- **Question:** Secure Access Portal for Client/Members
- **Answer:** Full 90-day access to the Client Console is initially provided for all patrons through eStatePlan’s FREE (My LifeCard Plan) Provisional Membership, which is always included with The eStatePlan purchase. The Client Console features powerful dynamics that enable users to modify (24/7) their Dynamic Trust Portfolio documents, Funding Kit ledgers, Advanced Medical Directives, PostScript Page, and E-vault Center portals. 5 Membership access to the Client Console beyond the FREE 90-day Provisional term requires a one-year renewable subscription (required for the first-time membership opt-in) payable with the user’s choice of either monthly or annual recurring billing. The MLCP Membership Subscription, while not required for the client/purchaser, is a vital component of the system. There are several benefits and dynamic features available to Member subscribers through their Client Consoles including: * Document Modification Functionality – allows client/users to modify their Dynamic Trust Portfolio at any time and as many times as may be necessary to maintain the updates associated with family planning conditions, goals and objectives that can frequently change. * Electronic Trust-Funding Applications – enables client/users to fund their trusts electronically by listing personal assets, including personal real estate interests, onto "Assignment Ledgers" that can be modified anytime as needed. * NotePad Center – provides a method for client/users to instantly communicate with all service parties concerning questions and/or obtaining professional assistance while having such digital exchanges permanently recorded and filed. * Advanced Medical Directives (AMD) – presents a comprehensive health care directive document that can be filled out ONLINE, electronically signed, and modified at any time later. * Emergency Online Medical Access – grants an attending physician or other health care provider immediate access to the AMD through the Physician Login Page using only the subscriber’s Membership Card ID number. * Share Console – provides select-limited access of the Client Console for the subscriber’s (outside) legal counsel, tax advisor, other service providers, to view entered data, personal documents and other information. * Postscript Page – presents entry fields to log wishes, family and/or personal references and directives, and provides a place to record password information under the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA). * E-Vault Center – provides a secure storage venue for various digital documents and important records and/or other items such as digitized photos.

- **Question:** The Domestic Asset Protection Trust
- **Answer:** Prior to the groundbreaking body of law – concerning self-settled spendthrift trusts – written primarily by Jonathan Blattmachr and later enacted by the State of Alaska in 1997, off-shore trusts were essentially the only option available for one to transfer personal assets away from one’s own name and full control into a special trust in order to remove those assets from being a resource to satisfy a potential legal claim all while maintaining a measurable benefit from those assets. That attractive arrangement was essentially what was being offered with off-shore planning mechanisms, and it became a well-known option for certain wealthy Americans. But the introduction of the domestic asset protection trust (DAPT) in 1997 changed the landscape. In fact, as of this writing, nineteen other states (a total of twenty) have enacted similar self-settled spendthrift trust law. So there is now a more affordable (and perhaps feasible) option available to many US citizens of “having one’s cake and eating it too” with the onset of the DAPT. However, not all DAPTs are equal. In fact, only those states with historic, previously favorable “pro-trust” laws have occupied the top ratings. In my view, and in the view of many others, Nevada stands at the very top. The remainder of this chapter will be about domestic asset protection law with the use of trusts. And because of Nevada’s stature in the field, it will be in particular about Nevada’s statutory asset protection trust law. Notice in the writing that I refer to the Nevada Asset Protection Trust (NAPT) as the Nevada Wealth Preservation Trust (NWPT), which we have trademarked in our company.

- **Question:** What Actually is a Transfer Tax?
- **Answer:** We start with an interesting fact. If you are a taxpayer with assets, the federal government (and most state governments) have a literal split-interest claim over every dollar you transfer whether during lifetime or upon your decease. Transfers made by the taxpayer/asset-owner during his lifetime are deemed as gifts and therefore subject to the federal “gift tax” table. Transfers made upon the taxpayer’s death are deemed as distributions from his estate and therefore subject to federal “estate tax” table. Both gift tax and estate tax are statutorily bundled and are ultimately imposed as a federal transfer tax. There is also an applied graduated scale to the federal transfer tax table, which currently starts at the 18% level and increases to 40%. And, conversely, there is an exemption available against the transfer tax. The exemption amounts have significantly increased over the years. As of this writing, the current maximum exemption amount is $12.92 million for a single transferor and $25.84 million for a married couple. If federal transfer tax obligations are still owed after the entire transfer tax credit has been applied, then a large estate is obviously involved. And the maximum (40%) taxable rate will be applied against any transfers exceeding the federal exemption equivalent amount.

- **Question:** Locating all assets assigned to the Trust
- **Answer:** If the grantor has assigned personal REALTY INTERESTS to the trust (i.e., to the trustee), such would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button (and the Spouse’s ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button – with a co-grantor trust). If the grantor has assigned NON-REALTY ASSETS to the trust, such would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Assets Transfer” button. If the grantor has intended to assign ASSETS PAYABLE to the trust, such assignments would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Assets Payable” button. Bring up the respective ESIGNed asset-transfer pages in order to print and for delivery to a transfer agent, or you may show the agent ONLINE through the Trustee Login portal. However, beneficiary-designation changes for insurance policies and other payable-in-death contracts are normally required to have been made at the institutional-vendor level, by the grantor, to affect the change. If that beneficiary (re)designation was not accomplished during the grantor’s lifetime, you can still present the ESIGN for Assets Payable” Ledger to the vendor institution. Depending on the governing contract, the vendor may otherwise accept the deceased grantor’s intent.

Good morning,

To locate the contract for your living trust acquisition, you can record REALTY INTERESTS assigned to the trust under the “ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button if you are the trustee. For NON-REALTY ASSETS, use the “ESIGN for Assets Transfer” button, and for ASSETS PAYABLE to the trust, access them through the “ESIGN for Assets Payable” button. You can print these asset-transfer pages for delivery to a transfer agent or show them online via the Trustee Login portal. If you need further assistance, I recommend contacting the relevant office regarding asset transfers.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

To locate the contract for your living trust acquisition, you should review the assets assigned to the trust. If personal realty interests were assigned, these would be recorded under the "ESIGN for Realty Transfers" button. For non-realty assets, check the "ESIGN for Assets Transfer" button, and for assets payable, review the "ESIGN for Assets Payable" button. You can access the respective ESIGNed asset-transfer pages for documentation or view them online through the Trustee Login portal. If beneficiary designations for payable-in-death contracts were not changed during the grantor's lifetime, please present the ESIGN for Assets Payable Ledger to the vendor institution.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

Good afternoon,

To locate the contract for your living trust acquisition, ensure that the grantor has assigned personal realty interests to the trust, as these are recorded under the "ESIGN for Realty Transfers" button. For non-realty assets, check under "ESIGN for Assets Transfer." If the grantor assigned assets payable to the trust, these would be recorded under "ESIGN for Assets Payable." You can access the respective ESIGNed asset-transfer pages for printing or delivery to a transfer agent via the Trustee Login portal. Ensure that any beneficiary-designation changes for insurance policies are made at the institutional level for proper effect.

I hope this information helps you find the contract you need! Please let me know if you need any additional assistance. Have a great day!

- **Question:** Locating all assets assigned to the Trust
- **Answer:** If the grantor has assigned personal REALTY INTERESTS to the trust (i.e., to the trustee), such would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button (and the Spouse’s ESIGN for Realty Transfers” button – with a co-grantor trust). If the grantor has assigned NON-REALTY ASSETS to the trust, such would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Assets Transfer” button. If the grantor has intended to assign ASSETS PAYABLE to the trust, such assignments would be recorded under the “ESIGN for Assets Payable” button. Bring up the respective ESIGNed asset-transfer pages in order to print and for delivery to a transfer agent, or you may show the agent ONLINE through the Trustee Login portal. However, beneficiary-designation changes for insurance policies and other payable-in-death contracts are normally required to have been made at the institutional-vendor level, by the grantor, to affect the change. If that beneficiary (re)designation was not accomplished during the grantor’s lifetime, you can still present the ESIGN for Assets Payable” Ledger to the vendor institution. Depending on the governing contract, the vendor may otherwise accept the deceased grantor’s intent.

- **Question:** Streamlining Trust Funding with the Quick Funding Method
- **Answer:** This material describes how to fund your Dynamic Trust with The eStatePlanTM Funding Kit utilizing the Quick Funding MethodTM (QFM) with (i) digital Asset Ledgers, (ii) electronic signature (ESIGN) technology, and (iii) the Master Signatory Guarantor recording certificate. The common methods of funding a Revocable Living Trust – that is, the formal retitling of equity accounts, personal realty deeds, and other assets to the grantor/trustee – can be a time-consuming, exasperating experience. But that has all changed now for those taking advantage of our QFM.

Then select the COT pages to print from your PDF viewer module. It will also show that it’s been implemented by an electronic signature (ESIGN) – assuming the decease grantor[s] previously ESIGNed the Dynamic Trust Portfolio. NOTE: It may not be necessary to print the COT if you provide the Trustee Login access information to the transfer agents needing the information as they may view the same online.

Good afternoon,

Your successor will not log in using your account credentials for the executor portal. Instead, at your decease, the successor trustee can access the Client Console via the Trustee/Executor Login. They can then open the Estate Settlement portal to use the Estate Settlement Primer and the Quick Reference Settlement Guide to retitle assets to themselves.

Good afternoon,

For your successor to log in using the executor portal, they will need to access the Client Console via the Trustee/Executor Login. At that time, they can utilize the Estate Settlement portal for relevant guides to manage the estate settlement process. Your account credentials should not be shared directly with your successor; they should have their access set up appropriately.

Good afternoon,

Heirs typically receive their money from the estate after the completion of the probate process, which can take several months or longer depending on the complexity of the estate. It's essential to engage with estate planning to avoid delays and costs associated with probate, which can include statutory fees of up to 5% of the gross estate value. Planning effectively can help ensure heirs receive their inheritances promptly. For detailed guidance on estate management, consult an estate planning professional.

- **Question:** Trust-Controlled Charitable Giving with Split Interests
- **Answer:** Charitable remainder trusts are “split interest” plans that allow creator/taxpayers to make irrevocable, “deferred-gift” contributions to such trusts, which shall eventually pass to the named charitable beneficiaries. The split-interest feature allows the taxpayer to name himself as the beneficiary of a lifetime income stream from the CRT – or for a term of up to 20 years to one or more non-charitable beneficiaries (including himself). The charity(s) shall receive the remainder of the donated assets at a later date (i.e.) after the defined termination of the CRT. There are two primary types of charitable trusts: Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs) & Charitable Lead Trusts (CLTs). CRTs can provide taxpayers with significant benefits including (i) income and estate tax savings, (ii) avoidance of long-term capital gains tax, (iii) increased income from appreciated property (otherwise having a low interest rate of return), (iv) controlling the terms of disposition/amounts of income for themselves and/or family members over a period of time, and (v) determining what sector of society (i.e., which charity[s]) will benefit from a given portion of their estates. CRTs can be established as "income only", income w/makeup", or "straight percentage" unitrusts (CRUTs), or as fixed-percentage annuity trusts (CRATs). And each provides the legal structure for the controlled, split-interest segment of charitable giving. Either of the CRT formats can provide lifetime income-stream benefits to the creator(s) and, if so elected, to family members for a term of up to 20 years beyond the life of the creator(s). NOTE: Often times CRT creators will establish "Wealth Replacement Trusts" (Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts) to replace the estate value otherwise allocated to the charity through the CRT. That occasion is more common when the charitable allocation is significantly large in value.

- **Question:** Costs, Privacy, and Emotional Impact of Probate
- **Answer:** Probate can be quite costly. For example, in some states, statutory fees are recognized and accepted by the court to pay the administrating law firm from the accounts of the estate being probated up to 5% (and sometimes more) of the gross estate value. To put that in perspective, let’s reduce that to 3% using a $1.5m gross estate being transferred with a net transferable value of (say) only $1m – after debts are paid. That would incur a $45,000 probate fee! When faced with the potential prospect, in this example, of paying $45,000 (or more) to transfer a net value of $1m to heirs, most asset owners would want to take action sooner than later. The questions, however, are always: (i) what to do? (ii) where to go? and (iii) who to contact? In addition to the potential of incurring heavy costs, privacy is completely forfeited since probate is most definitely a matter of civic disclosure and public record. Because of the lack of privacy and control, and the imminent shrinkage of the estate due to improper planning, the decedent’s family is now subjected to yet another negative factor – stress! Indeed, it is most certainly a worthwhile objective to avoid probate entirely regardless of the size of the estate. And that can surely be accomplished with proper planning.

Good afternoon,

Heirs typically receive their inheritance after the probate process, which can take time depending on your estate's complexity and state laws. To expedite this, consider proper estate planning to potentially avoid probate altogether. Costs associated with probate can be significant, and there can be emotional stress involved. Proper planning can alleviate these issues and streamline the transfer to heirs.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Heirs generally receive their inheritance after the estate goes through the probate process. This can include costs that may be incurred, such as attorney fees which can be up to 5% of the gross estate value. Therefore, planning to avoid probate is advisable to expedite inheritance distribution and reduce potential fees. The estate will be distributed once all debts are settled and necessary legal processes are completed. Effective planning can help ensure a smoother transition for heirs to receive their inheritance, whether through wills, trusts, or other estate planning tools.

Either of the CRT formats can provide lifetime income-stream benefits to the creator(s) and, if so elected, to family members for a term of up to 20 years beyond the life of the creator(s). NOTE: Often times CRT creators will establish "Wealth Replacement Trusts" (Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts) to replace the estate value otherwise allocated to the charity through the CRT. That occasion is more common when the charitable allocation is significantly large in value.

- **Question:** Costs, Privacy, and Emotional Impact of Probate
- **Answer:** Probate can be quite costly. For example, in some states, statutory fees are recognized and accepted by the court to pay the administrating law firm from the accounts of the estate being probated up to 5% (and sometimes more) of the gross estate value. To put that in perspective, let’s reduce that to 3% using a $1.5m gross estate being transferred with a net transferable value of (say) only $1m – after debts are paid. That would incur a $45,000 probate fee! When faced with the potential prospect, in this example, of paying $45,000 (or more) to transfer a net value of $1m to heirs, most asset owners would want to take action sooner than later. The questions, however, are always: (i) what to do? (ii) where to go? and (iii) who to contact? In addition to the potential of incurring heavy costs, privacy is completely forfeited since probate is most definitely a matter of civic disclosure and public record. Because of the lack of privacy and control, and the imminent shrinkage of the estate due to improper planning, the decedent’s family is now subjected to yet another negative factor – stress! Indeed, it is most certainly a worthwhile objective to avoid probate entirely regardless of the size of the estate. And that can surely be accomplished with proper planning.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,  

The successor trustee begins managing the trust immediately upon the death of the trustor/trustee. This takeover occurs without the need for any outside approval or supervision, simply by operation of law through the legally binding terms of the trust. After the trustor's death, the trust becomes irrevocable, and the successor trustee may either manage the trust assets on behalf of the beneficiaries or distribute the assets outright to them.  

For estate administration, the time it takes can vary widely depending on several factors, including the complexity of the estate and any disputes that may arise. Generally, the process can range from a few months to over a year. Simple estates often settle quicker, while more complex cases, especially those involving litigation or tax issues, may take significantly longer.  

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** The Operations of a Living Trust
- **Answer:** In simple terms, a living trust is an agreement between the trustor, also called the settlor/grantor, and the trustee. The trustor transfers title of assets to the "office" of the trustee. The (successor) trustee can then manage and eventually distribute those assets on behalf of the beneficiaries of the trust. Remarkably, with a living trust, one person or a married couple can function as all three parties – trustor, trustee and beneficiary – at the same time! When the trustor/trustee dies, the successor trustee (who was originally appointed by the trustor) immediately assumes the office and duties of the trustee without the requirement of any outside approval or supervision. Trustee succession to the title of trust assets simply occurs by operation of law through the legally binding terms of the trust. Thus, probate court is not needed to accomplish the (re)titling of assets to the successor trustee for the eventual transfer to the heirs. After the death of the trustor, the trust becomes irrevocable; that is, it cannot be changed. Per the terms of the trust, the successor trustee will then either manage the trust assets on behalf of the beneficiaries and/or distribute the assets outright to them. It’s that simple!

- **Question:** POD/TOD Plans Avoid Estate Settlement Problems. Right?
- **Answer:** Ancillary POD & TOD arrangements are essentially the same in their primary functions (PODs are typically offered through banks and TODs through investment institutions), which is to avoid probate of the account upon the owner’s decease. Such arrangements are easy and inexpensive to create. The account owner names a beneficiary(s) to take title of the account immediately upon his decease; probate of the account is avoided. So, what could possibly go wrong? First, it should be understood that financial institutions provide these services solely as a front-end incentive to draw (and keep) clientele. They are not helping to establish an effective personal estate plan in the client’s best interests, nor can they. Moreover, those institutions offering such probate-avoidance “features” generally don’t disclose to the account owner (unless by fine print) that with the POD/TOD arrangement(s) he could actually be creating a “new set of circumstances” that could make for an undesirable outcome – upon the account owner’s decease – now after the POD/TOD account-transfer planning has been employed.

- **Question:** Key Considerations for Completing Estate Settlement
- **Answer:** * Paperless Transitions. It is recommended that to utilize the online access features provided through the Trustee/Executor Login page in conjunction with the transfer agents you are dealing with to help make the transfer actions a “paperless” event. The utilization of paperless transitions as much as possible can save time when settling the estate. * Estate Tax Liabilities. Rules governing federal and state estate (and inheritance) taxes regularly change; so it is recommended that you contact professional counsel if you have related questions since you can be held liable as the trustee/executor for any unpaid federal and/or estate taxes that may be due. Also, realize that certain state revenue departments may require a tax-report affidavit to be submitted by the trustee or executor within a certain time frame of the grantor/testator’s decease. * When Probate is Needed. If the deceased grantor failed to assign all personal assets to the trust (or make payable to the trust), and that particular asset was not held in a Joint-Tenants- with-Right-of-Survivorship (JTWROS) format, then probate will likely be required of that asset. In such case, you will need to arrange for probate proceedings to have the court to first “prove the will” and then to transfer the (non-funded-to-trust) asset to you as the executor of the testator’s will. Professional assistance is recommended. * Federal Income Reporting Elections/Filings. 26 USC §645 allows the trustee of a deceased grantor’s revocable living trust to classify the trust as a “qualified revocable trust” – so as to file the trust estate income tax return as if it were the decedent’s personal estate – if the trust estate is to be “wrapped up” within two years from the grantor’s decease. That may be advantageous since personal estates may use a “fiscal” (instead of calendar) year, which begins at the date of decease, for reporting purposes. Also, a 1041 fiduciary return will not be required if the trust/estate generated less than $600 of “gross income” for the fiscal year. In such case, it would not then be necessary to apply for a federal EIN (tax ID) since the reporting of earned income for the fiscal year, if under $600, would not be required. * Estate Settlement Center. A comprehensive Estate Settlement Package, which is available exclusively through the Client Console, can further help to facilitate both the estate settlement and wrap up process. If it was not acquired by the client, it can be purchased by the trustee through the Trustee/Executor Login portal. * SEEK HELP WHEN NEEDED. Depending on the circumstances, an estate settlement can be a challenging and even daunting process. Personally-committed (although innocent) settlement errors and omissions can carry personal liability. If you have been appointed as the Successor Trustee but do not feel adequate or qualified to perform the duties then seek professional help. If you are concerned, don't hesitate to employ a law office or a trust company to help you do what they're trained to do.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

The successor trustee starts managing the trust immediately upon the death of the trustor/trustee. This transition does not require outside approval or supervision, as the successor trustee was already appointed by the trustor. Once the trustor passes away, the trust becomes irrevocable, and the successor trustee will manage the trust assets for the beneficiaries or distribute the assets according to the trust terms.

The duration of estate administration can vary widely depending on several factors, including the size and complexity of the estate, the jurisdiction's laws, and whether the estate encounters any disputes or challenges. Generally, the process may take several months to a few years to complete, especially if probate is required. To ensure efficiency, it’s recommended to work with a qualified trustee or estate planning professional. Engaging a professional can help navigate administrative tasks and avoid potential delays.

- **Question:** The Nevada Situs for Non-Residents
- **Answer:** Designating Nevada as the situs (applied jurisdiction) for a trust created by a grantor who is not a citizen of Nevada can be accomplished by decree in the trust instrument. The Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws § 268-270 (1971) states that courts are to uphold a grantor's selection of jurisdiction to govern a trust as long as the trust is valid under the law of the state selected (and that rule applies even though the laws of the grantor's domicile may not recognize the trust as enforceable). * Nevada's version of the Uniform Trust Code provides that the statutory laws of the state, when selected by the transferor/grantor in the governing trust instrument, control the meaning and legal effect of the trust as long as the grantor’s application of that law is not contrary to Nevada public policy. 3 * Under NRS Chapter 164-045, Nevada allows anyone, regardless of what state they are currently residing in now or upon decease, to establish a Nevada- sitused trust. Unless otherwise opted by the client, the Dynamic Trust Portfolio trust documents “default select” Nevada law in order to use the pro-trust administration laws provided under Nevada jurisdiction.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Trustees can access the trust portal via the Trustee/Executor Login. This login provides access to the Client Console, where they can manage information and open the Estate Settlement portal to assist with various estate-related tasks. For corporate trustees, all client information will be stored in The eStatePlan cloud for easy access under the same Trustee/Executor Login.

The security measures for the trust portal include the utilization of Turbo SSL (TM) for encryption, advanced cybersecurity and penetration testing services by JURINNOV, and compliance with PCI Data Security Standards (DSS). The platform also employs a secure Database Management System (DBMS) that uses the same algorithms as regulated financial institutions. Additionally, an optional Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances password security for clients. Personal passwords must be securely managed by users, as they are not recoverable through standard protocols. These measures ensure protection against unauthorized access and maintain the integrity of client data.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Answer:** ## Notice of Privacy Policy ### Commitment to Privacy and Data Security Integrated Trust Systems / ITS Alliance Partners, LLC recognizes all end-user client rights to privacy. We are committed to the highest standards of data encryption technology by utilizing Turbo SSL (TM) – Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software – to keep client database records protected and secure. The exclusion of access to personal client records from unauthorized persons is as important to us as it is to you. IN ADDITION, we have installed advanced cyber security/penetration testing procedures and safety requirements to help maintain the integrity and permanency of client data: ### Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing ITS incorporated JURINNOV cybersecurity penetration, vulnerability, and data- breach response testing services over a period of several consecutive months. JURINNOV services provided proactive, compliant, vigilant and responsive approaches to protecting and securing data by helping to balance the risks associated with the transmission, storage, processing and external access to cloud- based information. JURINNOV (post-test) tracking reports created recommended solutions, when necessary, which were then monitored in succeeding, conclusive tests. The security metrics incorporated into the ITS platform ranked in the top 3% of all JURINNOV'S corporate clients at the conclusion of the testing series. ### PCI Data Security Standards Compliance ITS is in compliance with the safety requirements set by the Payment Card Industry's (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS) that are designed to ensure that the processing, storing, and transmitting of credit card information is done in a safe and secure environment. For your review, we also provide public disclosure to our responses on an industry-standard Vendor Cybersecurity Questionnaire. ### Client Information Practices Furthermore, in exercising the proper methods of gathering, maintaining, and using client information, we adhere to the following practices: * We collect, record and transfer information only as is necessary to enable our Internet service platform to provide end-user clients with the personal experience they need to help reach their respective estate planning goals. * Services requiring data-exchanges between affiliated parties may be necessary to analyze, edit, and submit personal data by personal advisors and legal counsel – or other appropriate sources – for the proper creation, funding, and implementation of prescribed estate plans. However, client files will not be transferred or made available to any other organization not authorized or otherwise connected by a service and/or marketing relationship to our processing network. * Any networking party associated with our Internet Platform Protocol sending or receiving personal client data must agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy Notice(s) prohibiting electronic files to be used for any other reason other than to coordinate and establish end-user client estate plans. Notwithstanding, we do not monitor related party activities beyond our data-exchange protocol requirements. * Through pre-arranged contractual agreements, clients and their family members (of the client's choice) may have access to personal information, through Client Consoles, electronically stored on our database, which also may be sent to us from other related sources. In any event, all personal information will be used only to accomplish the desired end result(s) for which purchases of our services have been made. ### Government Oversight and Attorney General Login As with any industry (especially those utilizing sophisticated data-exchange systems), our company and service platform may be subject to internal due diligence investigations by authorized governmental agencies. To facilitate any such investigative requests, we have created an Attorney General Login (AGL) page. The AGL page allows Attorney General Offices, in any state, Internet access (after provided with a secure database password) to view and analyze all pertinent client data-exchange occurrences and protocol activity between related service parties.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Beneficiaries will receive distributions outright once they have attained age 21, as specified in your trust. Additionally, if the trust is structured appropriately, beneficiaries of Inherited IRAs are generally required to take all vested IRA benefits within 10 years of the IRA owner's death. They can choose to withdraw these benefits in various ways, such as in equal portions each year, at varying times, or as a lump sum at the end of the 10-year period. Customization options are available based on the trust directives.

Once the IRA distributions are made to the beneficiaries, they are generally taxable income to them at their individual tax rates. If an Irrevocable Living Trust or similar entity receives distributions and does not promptly pass them to the beneficiaries, the trust itself becomes responsible for the tax on those distributions at potentially higher trust income tax rates. Properly managed distributions, such as those specified outright in a trust, can mitigate tax complications. Ensure compliance with SECURE Act terms to optimize benefits and reduce tax liabilities.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** Trusts that Qualify as a Designated Beneficiary
- **Answer:** There are requirements that trusts must satisfy to be deemed a Designated Beneficiary Trust (DBT). A DBT will be authorized to receive IRA distributions on behalf of a designated beneficiary but within the terms of the SECURE Act. NOTE: Unlike a trust, a probate estate cannot qualify as a designated beneficiary of a qualified IRA. [See Treasury Reg. §1.401(a)(9)-4 and Private Letter Ruling PLR 2001- 26401]. That means that if an IRA owner dies before his RBD with a simple will or no will at all, without naming a qualified beneficiary(s) or a DBT as the beneficiary(s) of his IRA, the five- year payout rule automatically applies regardless of the ages of decedent’s heirs because his estate – which is a non-qualified beneficiary – will become the beneficiary of his IRA by default. A trust may qualify as a DBT if it passes four tests: (1) be valid under state law; (2) be completely irrevocable (a RLT becomes irrevocable at the death of the grantor) including with regard to beneficiary changes (i.e., trustee cannot be granted powers to sprinkle assets in its discretion or to designate other beneficiaries); (3) have natural individuals as beneficiaries who are separately identifiable and are thus qualified to receive benefits from an IRA (estates, corporations, partnerships& charities or any other institutions as such do not qualify as beneficiaries of an IRA); and (4) be presented to the IRA administrator when created or enforced as an irrevocable trust (e.g., generally at the death of the grantor) by October 31st of the year following the owner/grantor’s death, in order to certify the beneficiaries of the trust as of September 30th of the same year.

- **Question:** Inherited IRA Trusts w/SECURE Act
- **Answer:** Prior to 2020, taxpayers with Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) (and certain other retirement plans) were able to optimize Minimum Required Distribution (MRD) rules with the recalculation allowances for mandated beneficiary distributions and an appointed trustee to receive and allocate minimum distributions on behalf of a designated beneficiary. By blending those options with a qualified trust, IRA owners were able to employ post-mortem control on beneficiary withdrawal rights not otherwise obtainable without a trust. However, the SECURE Act of 2020 rewrote that model with significant changes concerning Inherited IRAs. Under the new rules, with certain exceptions, beneficiaries of Inherited IRAs will be required to take all vested IRA benefits within 10 years of the IRA owner's decease. However, custom withdrawal options are available for the astute planner. Withdrawals can be made (i) in 10 approximate equal portions each year, or (ii) at various times and amounts during the 10-year period without minimum (or maximum) limitations, and/or (iii) as a one-lump-sum distribution of the entire account at the end of the 10-year period.

- **Question:** Defining Inherited IRA Trusts
- **Answer:** Understanding Inherited IRA Trusts, also known as “Designated Beneficiary Trusts” (DBTs), begins by realizing that a DBT (Inherited IRA Trust) essentially exists as an unfunded Revocable Living Trust (RLT) until the IRA owner dies. However, with our eStatePlan format, a funded RLT can also serve as a DBT when an IRA is made payable to it given that the proper Custom Trust Directives are used. As a general rule, making any RLT a (primary or) contingent beneficiary of an IRA should be avoided without complicit SECURE Act language in the RLT. A properly drafted RLT/DBT contains language that will allow the IRA vendor to distribute portions of the IRA to the trustee according to the terms of the trust, who then distributes to the named beneficiary(s). If the trust contains dispositive language that directs distributions not conforming to the rules of the SECURE Act (for Inherited IRA purposes) then it will not work as a DBT, and the trust will consequently be set aside for IRA distribution purposes as though it did not exist. With that said, if an IRA were made payable to a trust which specified that equal shares are to be distributed outright and immediately to the beneficiaries, as an example, then those beneficiaries would get equal shares of the IRA with no problems. That’s because distributions through outright allocation clauses in a trust are obviously within the SECURE Act’s 10-year depletion rules. A RLT may neither own nor hold qualified IRA funds – whether if during the IRA owner’s life or after decease – unless it utilizes a special IRA Administrative Trustee format (see Article #5 on the ITS website / The eStatePlan SuperCharged IRA). Once the IRA monies leave the IRA vendor’s account, such becomes immediately taxable to the designated beneficiary(s) identified in the trust, and the trustee would make a “K1” (e.g., 1099) distribution to the beneficiary. If the trust received IRA transfers from the vendor and did not distribute it outright then the trust would need to pay the tax on the IRA distributions at trust income tax rates, which gets to the very top of the graduated scale in a short time. (It’s quite apparent that Uncle Sam does not like having IRA distributions held IN TRUST.)

- **Question:** Estate Tax Implications of IRA Beneficiary Designations
- **Answer:** Regardless of whether a qualified plan owner designates his trust as a beneficiary of his plan, the value of the plan will be includable in his estate for transfer tax purposes. A prime example of the importance of choosing a proper designated beneficiary is with the realization that an IRA can qualify for the marital deduction if transferred to a spouse; or, it can be transferred under the shelter of the unified credit, up to a certain amount, when conveyed to non-spousal beneficiaries such as children. For a married retirement account owner who has a large estate, it may make sense to simply name his or her spouse as the primary beneficiary of the IRA, with the trust as contingent beneficiary. Naming the trust, rather than the spouse, as the primary beneficiary of a large retirement account could ultimately cause an unnecessary estate tax liability – in addition to the income tax liability – as a result of transferring the plan through the Credit Shelter Trust to non-spouse beneficiaries. Conversely, if the account owner’s spouse receives a large distribution from the plan through the marital deduction, the participant’s unified credit will not be unnecessarily utilized to shelter any of deceased spouse’s qualified plan from transfer tax. However, with that method, the spouse may acquire an estate tax problem that previously did not exist. It is obvious that, for married participants with moderate to large estates, transfer tax planning with IRAs is important.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Beneficiaries will receive distributions outright once they attain age 21, as specified in your trust. You have the option to modify this 21-year minimum through the Custom Trust Directives on your Data Entry page. For Inherited IRAs, beneficiaries must take all vested IRA benefits within 10 years of the owner's death. Custom withdrawal options are available, allowing withdrawals in approximately 10 equal portions, at various times during the 10-year period, or as a lump sum at the end of the period.

The tax implications of distributions from a Tier3 Nevada Wealth Preservation Trust (NWPT) include that all trust income is taxable to the grantor, even if not distributed. Additionally, any income distributed to others is treated as a taxable gift from the grantor for transfer tax purposes. Furthermore, all transfers to a Tier3 NWPT are considered "incompleted gifts," making the assets includable in the grantor’s taxable estate upon their death. The transferred assets receive a step-up in basis upon the grantor's decease due to their incompleted gift status.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** Tax Considerations
- **Answer:** The original intent of irrevocable trusts is to remove the corpus of the trust from the taxable estate of the transferor; transfer tax laws turn on this concept. A gift, whether to an individual or to a qualified irrevocable trust, is valued as to its full market value on the date of the gift. This full market value is used in determining if the gift can be sheltered under the annual exclusion and/or if the federal unified credit should be taken against the transfer tax incurred at the time of transfer. Notwithstanding, any such completed gift, as described above, shall "pass through" the original basis of the donor to the donee. That means that if the donee sells the property, his capital gains tax liability (if any) will be calculated on the gain determined by subtracting the basis of the property of the original donor from the appreciated basis of the property at the time of sale by the donee.If a transfer can be revoked by the transferor or anyone in conjunction with the transferor who is not an adverse party to the revocation, or if the transferor retains a right to the income of the transferred property, then no completed gift has occurred (IRC #674 / Treasury Reg. #25.2511-2). In such case, the value of the property will be in the transferor's estate for transfer tax purposes and thus be "stepped-up" at the date of the transferor's decease. This scenario provides an interesting tax planning tool for the average family estate with appreciated property.

Good afternoon,

Beneficiaries will receive outright distributions once they attain the age of 21, as prescribed in your trust. You have the option to modify this 21-year minimum via the Custom Trust Directives table/text box on your Data Entry page. Additionally, under the SECURE Act, for Inherited IRAs, beneficiaries are generally required to take all vested IRA benefits within 10 years of the IRA owner's death, with custom withdrawal options available for distributions during this period.

Distributions from a Tier3 NWPT can have significant tax implications. If the grantor retains veto power over the trustee's intended distributions under §2036 and has limited appointment powers under §2038, all trust income will be taxable to the grantor, even if not distributed to them. Additionally, any income distributed to beneficiaries becomes a taxable gift from the grantor for transfer tax purposes. Transfers to a Tier3 NWPT are considered "incompleted gifts," which means they are included in the grantor's taxable estate upon death and may receive a step-up in basis due to their status as incompleted gifts.

Under the new rules, with certain exceptions, beneficiaries of Inherited IRAs will be required to take all vested IRA benefits within 10 years of the IRA owner's decease. However, custom withdrawal options are available for the astute planner. Withdrawals can be made (i) in 10 approximate equal portions each year, or (ii) at various times and amounts during the 10-year period without minimum (or maximum) limitations, and/or (iii) as a one-lump-sum distribution of the entire account at the end of the 10-year period.

- **Question:** Trustee Discretion and Limitations Under Nevada NWPTs
- **Answer:** A trustee of a NWPT cannot be required to: * NOTIFY A CREDITOR or to disclose the terms of an outright distribution made to the beneficiary – regardless of the value of the distribution; * MAKE AN OUTRIGHT DISTRIBUTION(s) regardless if distributions from the trust are subject to the trustee's exercise of discretion; * WITHHOLD A DISTRIBUTION to or for the benefit of the beneficiary whether or not distributions from the trust are subject to the trustee's discretion; * COERCE THE BENEFICIARY to exercise a power of appointment over his beneficial interest or to revoke the trust.

- **Question:** Tax Considerations
- **Answer:** The original intent of irrevocable trusts is to remove the corpus of the trust from the taxable estate of the transferor; transfer tax laws turn on this concept. A gift, whether to an individual or to a qualified irrevocable trust, is valued as to its full market value on the date of the gift. This full market value is used in determining if the gift can be sheltered under the annual exclusion and/or if the federal unified credit should be taken against the transfer tax incurred at the time of transfer. Notwithstanding, any such completed gift, as described above, shall "pass through" the original basis of the donor to the donee. That means that if the donee sells the property, his capital gains tax liability (if any) will be calculated on the gain determined by subtracting the basis of the property of the original donor from the appreciated basis of the property at the time of sale by the donee.If a transfer can be revoked by the transferor or anyone in conjunction with the transferor who is not an adverse party to the revocation, or if the transferor retains a right to the income of the transferred property, then no completed gift has occurred (IRC #674 / Treasury Reg. #25.2511-2). In such case, the value of the property will be in the transferor's estate for transfer tax purposes and thus be "stepped-up" at the date of the transferor's decease. This scenario provides an interesting tax planning tool for the average family estate with appreciated property.

- **Question:** Defining Inherited IRA Trusts
- **Answer:** Understanding Inherited IRA Trusts, also known as “Designated Beneficiary Trusts” (DBTs), begins by realizing that a DBT (Inherited IRA Trust) essentially exists as an unfunded Revocable Living Trust (RLT) until the IRA owner dies. However, with our eStatePlan format, a funded RLT can also serve as a DBT when an IRA is made payable to it given that the proper Custom Trust Directives are used. As a general rule, making any RLT a (primary or) contingent beneficiary of an IRA should be avoided without complicit SECURE Act language in the RLT. A properly drafted RLT/DBT contains language that will allow the IRA vendor to distribute portions of the IRA to the trustee according to the terms of the trust, who then distributes to the named beneficiary(s). If the trust contains dispositive language that directs distributions not conforming to the rules of the SECURE Act (for Inherited IRA purposes) then it will not work as a DBT, and the trust will consequently be set aside for IRA distribution purposes as though it did not exist. With that said, if an IRA were made payable to a trust which specified that equal shares are to be distributed outright and immediately to the beneficiaries, as an example, then those beneficiaries would get equal shares of the IRA with no problems. That’s because distributions through outright allocation clauses in a trust are obviously within the SECURE Act’s 10-year depletion rules. A RLT may neither own nor hold qualified IRA funds – whether if during the IRA owner’s life or after decease – unless it utilizes a special IRA Administrative Trustee format (see Article #5 on the ITS website / The eStatePlan SuperCharged IRA). Once the IRA monies leave the IRA vendor’s account, such becomes immediately taxable to the designated beneficiary(s) identified in the trust, and the trustee would make a “K1” (e.g., 1099) distribution to the beneficiary. If the trust received IRA transfers from the vendor and did not distribute it outright then the trust would need to pay the tax on the IRA distributions at trust income tax rates, which gets to the very top of the graduated scale in a short time. (It’s quite apparent that Uncle Sam does not like having IRA distributions held IN TRUST.)

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Probate can be quite costly. Statutory fees in some states may be up to 5% (or more) of the gross estate value when paid from the estate accounts. This can lead to significant probate fees; for example, with a $1.5 million estate, you could potentially see a $45,000 fee to transfer the net value of $1 million to heirs. Additionally, probate leads to a loss of privacy, as it is a matter of public record.

To mitigate these costs and avoid probate entirely, effective estate planning is essential. Utilizing a Revocable Living Trust (RLT) is highly recommended, as it provides necessary privacy and administrative efficiencies. Proper planning can significantly impact the overall outcomes for heirs.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** Costs, Privacy, and Emotional Impact of Probate
- **Answer:** Probate can be quite costly. For example, in some states, statutory fees are recognized and accepted by the court to pay the administrating law firm from the accounts of the estate being probated up to 5% (and sometimes more) of the gross estate value. To put that in perspective, let’s reduce that to 3% using a $1.5m gross estate being transferred with a net transferable value of (say) only $1m – after debts are paid. That would incur a $45,000 probate fee! When faced with the potential prospect, in this example, of paying $45,000 (or more) to transfer a net value of $1m to heirs, most asset owners would want to take action sooner than later. The questions, however, are always: (i) what to do? (ii) where to go? and (iii) who to contact? In addition to the potential of incurring heavy costs, privacy is completely forfeited since probate is most definitely a matter of civic disclosure and public record. Because of the lack of privacy and control, and the imminent shrinkage of the estate due to improper planning, the decedent’s family is now subjected to yet another negative factor – stress! Indeed, it is most certainly a worthwhile objective to avoid probate entirely regardless of the size of the estate. And that can surely be accomplished with proper planning.

Good afternoon,

Probate can be quite costly, with statutory fees in some states reaching up to 5% of the gross estate value. For example, on a $1.5 million estate, this could amount to a probate fee of $45,000 to transfer a net value of $1 million to heirs. To avoid these costs, consider establishing a Revocable Living Trust (RLT), which provides privacy, control, and significant cost savings while addressing basic estate planning needs. Proper planning can help circumvent the emotional stress and public disclosure associated with probate.

The timeline for probate administration can vary significantly, but can often involve substantial costs and emotional stress. In some states, statutory fees can equal up to 5% of the gross estate value. For instance, for a $1.5 million estate, probate fees could exceed $45,000, which may motivate estate owners to take action sooner rather than later. It is advisable to consider methods for avoiding probate entirely, as proper planning can alleviate many associated issues. Utilizing a Revocable Living Trust (RLT) can provide privacy and efficiency, and it's recommended as a foundational tool for estate planning.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Yes, real estate can be placed in a trust. The eStatePlan funding kit allows you to electronically record asset information and assign those assets, including personal real estate, to your trust. A formal realty deed is not necessary if the owner of the property is also the trustee of the trust. You must meet certain requirements, including compliance with the statute of frauds, and a written declaration of trust is sufficient to create the trust in that property. If you own real estate through an LLC, you would assign your LLC interest to the trust instead of the property directly.

Cemetery plots can also be included in a trust as part of an estate plan. Proper trust planning allows for the management and protection of such assets. It is essential to consult with a legal expert regarding specific state laws and to ensure that the trust is drafted correctly for your needs.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** Introduction to the eStatePlan Funding Kit
- **Answer:** ## Introduction to the eStatePlan Funding Kit The eStatePlan funding kit module provides you with the ability to electronically record your asset information to an Asset Assignment Ledger, and then to assign those assets listed on that ledger to your trust by your electronic signature. ## Assets Assigned to Trust and Probate Avoidance Assets assigned to your trust avoid probate, similarly as a Transfer on Death (POD) account would avoid probate. For more detailed information, see the research paper connected to the Funding Your eStatePlan link located in the top paragraph of the Funding Kit page. ## Starting with the Asset Entries Page When using your Funding Kit, always start with the Asset Entries Page button. When clicked, it will load an itemized horizontal menu bar at the top and a coordinated Table of Contents on the page where you can select the asset you want to assign or have payable to your trust. ## Entering Asset Information After selecting a particular asset type, enter the appropriate information in the entry fields of that asset type page to identify the asset you are assigning or making payable to trust. ## Handling Liquidated or Replaced Assets If the asset has been liquidated or replaced, simply delete it from the page, then go to another page to save your changes or click Save / Return to Console. ## Pages 1 Through 7 – Asset Categories Pages 1 through 7 include personal real estate, notes payable to you, closely held business interests, cash accounts, registered security accounts, and stocks and bonds including treasury bonds. ## Assigning Assets to Your Trust These are assets that can be formally deeded or retitled to your trust, or they can be easily and quickly assigned to your trust by using the assignment ledgers featured in your funding kit. ## Special Case – Real Estate in LLC If you own real estate in a formal entity such as an LLC, you would assign your LLC interest to the trust and not the actual property since the LLC owns the real estate, and you own a Membership interest in the LLC. ## Pages 8 Through 11 – Transfer on Death Options Assets identified in pages 8 through 11 are generally owned with transfer on death options included on the products account. ## Beneficiary Structure of Trust Assets Such assets can be made payable to your trust as either a primary or contingent beneficiary depending upon how you're structuring your plan. ## IRA Beneficiary Arrangements for Married Couples As a general rule, most married couples who establish a living trust arrange for their spouse to be the primary beneficiary of their IRAs and the trust as their contingent. ## Traditional IRA as Trust Beneficiary When your trust becomes a beneficiary of a traditional IRA, it can function as a qualified designated beneficiary trust enabling you to control the dispositions from the inherited IRA after your disease. ## Roth IRA as Trust Beneficiary Roth IRAs can be made payable to your trust as well. Remember that when listing an asset as payable to your trust, you should notify the custodian vendor of that asset to request that such change be made and logged into their records. ## Page 12 – Motorized Vehicles Item or page 12 is reserved primarily for motorized vehicles such as cars and trucks. However, you may list any type of vehicle there, whether land-based, water-traveled, or airborne. ## Page 12 – VIN-Based Assets and Personal Chattel In other words, anything that has a VIN number can be listed on page 12. Household goods, jewelry, collections, medals, etc. that have new account or ID number are considered to be personal chattel. Included with chattel, copyrights, or any other intellectual properties and royalties are assets that are generally assigned to your trust by way of the assignment of personal property document which is included in your Dynamic Trust Portfolio. ## Page 13 – Nevada Wealth Preservation Trust Item or page 13 is reserved for a list of assets being assigned to the Nevada Wealth Wealth Preservation Trust and item or page 14 may be used to list any type of asset not covered by the previous Funding Kit pages.

- **Question:** APPELLATE COURT ➢ ESTATE OF HEGGSTAD (1993)
- **Answer:** In the Estate of Heggstad case, a California Court of Appeals ruled that a separate, formal realty deed was not necessary to affect a transfer of realty property to a trust where the grantor was currently serving as trustee. The court stated: “It is well established that if two specific requirements are met, real property may be made part of a trust's assets WITHOUT (emphasis added) a separate deed transferring property to the trust. The first requirement is that the owner of real property is the settlor creating the trust with himself or herself (serving) as the trustee. Second, because a conveyance of real property is at issue, the other requirement for transferring real property to a trust is compliance with the statute of frauds. Accordingly, a written declaration of trust by the owner of real property, in which he names himself as trustee, is sufficient to create a trust in that property (i.e. without the use of a formal realty deed to affect the transfer)."

- **Answer:** Windows of opportunity are still available for asset owners wanting to protect their estate yet without giving away all the beneficial enjoyment of their assets. Depending on state law then in force (and cooperative courts), proper trust planning can provide a way around this property ownership/protection dilemma when correctly applied and fully implemented. Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the corpus (principal) of irrevocable grantor trusts was generally not considered a part of the grantor's taxable estate. That has changed since passage of the 86 TRA. In order for the corpus of irrevocable Grantor Retained Income Trusts (GRITs) to be excluded from the taxable estate of the Decedent/Grantor, certain rules generally have to apply. Although tax law can impact the corpus of such a trust in a grantor's taxable estate, a properly drafted GRIT can usually avoid being in the grantor's estate for Medicaid creditor purposes and yet be set up to allow the grantor to receive an income stream from the GRIT for his/her lifetime. So, it is a specially designed income-only, non-reversionary GRIT that can be effective in protecting personal assets from a spend down because of a prolonged nursing home occupancy yet allow the grantor to legally retain certain beneficial rights and lifetime enjoyment of the transferred assets. Such type of "medicaid qualifying" planning can be realized through what is referred to as a Medicaid Qualifying Trust (MQT).

- **Question:** Inherited IRAs Can Maintain Protection with a Trust
- **Answer:** Trusts created under a statutory “legal shield”, which protects against civil creditor judgments, serves as a “spendthrift trust”. Certain states recognize owned IRAs as spendthrift trusts while under custodial administration and will maintain that status throughout the IRA owner’s lifetime. Some states do not recognize spendthrift trust rules with IRA owner accounts. For other states, it depends on the total value of the IRA. The following pertains to ERISA type plans and not to federal government plans such as IRAs. As mentioned, some states have applied the same rules to IRAs. * IRC §401(a)(13)(A) provides that “a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated”. * The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) more clearly defines the rule stating that an anti-alienation clause(s) must be included in the retirement plan for it to be valid as a qualified plan, viz: “[A] trust will not be qualified unless the plan of which the trust is a part of provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be anticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, or subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process” (Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)-13(b)[1]). Inherited IRAs payable to a trust can enjoy certain asset protection benefits that may not have applied to the IRA owner. However, if a beneficiary has a right to receive an outright distribution from a trust then that particular distribution value (whether withdrawn or not) would be available to satisfy a creditor claim. The asset protection part comes into play by virtue of the trustee holding assets in trust because the language of the trust mandates it that way and not because the beneficiary simply directs the trustee not to distribute to him.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good morning,

Yes, real estate can be placed in a trust. A California Court ruled that a formal deed is not necessary if the property owner is also the trustee of the trust. It's sufficient to have a written declaration of trust naming the owner as trustee, allowing the property to be part of the trust's assets. If you own real estate through an LLC, you would assign your LLC interest to the trust, rather than the property itself. To assign real estate, you can use the asset assignment ledgers in the eStatePlan funding kit.

For cemetery plots to be placed in a trust, you will need to establish the trust appropriately, ensuring it aligns with legal regulations regarding real property. While specific regulations and guidelines may vary by state, trusts can generally hold property, including cemetery plots. It may be useful to consult with a legal professional to draft the trust document correctly and ensure compliance with relevant laws.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

For more detailed information, see the research paper connected to the Funding Your eStatePlan link located in the top paragraph of the Funding Kit page. ## Starting with the Asset Entries Page When using your Funding Kit, always start with the Asset Entries Page button. When clicked, it will load an itemized horizontal menu bar at the top and a coordinated Table of Contents on the page where you can select the asset you want to assign or have payable to your trust. ## Entering Asset Information After selecting a particular asset type, enter the appropriate information in the entry fields of that asset type page to identify the asset you are assigning or making payable to trust. ## Handling Liquidated or Replaced Assets If the asset has been liquidated or replaced, simply delete it from the page, then go to another page to save your changes or click Save / Return to Console. ## Pages 1 Through 7 – Asset Categories Pages 1 through 7 include personal real estate, notes payable to you, closely held business interests, cash accounts, registered security accounts, and stocks and bonds including treasury bonds. ## Assigning Assets to Your Trust These are assets that can be formally deeded or retitled to your trust, or they can be easily and quickly assigned to your trust by using the assignment ledgers featured in your funding kit. ## Special Case – Real Estate in LLC If you own real estate in a formal entity such as an LLC, you would assign your LLC interest to the trust and not the actual property since the LLC owns the real estate, and you own a Membership interest in the LLC. ## Pages 8 Through 11 – Transfer on Death Options Assets identified in pages 8 through 11 are generally owned with transfer on death options included on the products account. ## Beneficiary Structure of Trust Assets Such assets can be made payable to your trust as either a primary or contingent beneficiary depending upon how you're structuring your plan. ## IRA Beneficiary Arrangements for Married Couples As a general rule, most married couples who establish a living trust arrange for their spouse to be the primary beneficiary of their IRAs and the trust as their contingent. ## Traditional IRA as Trust Beneficiary When your trust becomes a beneficiary of a traditional IRA, it can function as a qualified designated beneficiary trust enabling you to control the dispositions from the inherited IRA after your disease. ## Roth IRA as Trust Beneficiary Roth IRAs can be made payable to your trust as well.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Yes, real estate can be placed in a trust. A recent California Court of Appeals decision (Estate of Heggstad) determined that a separate formal deed is not needed for transferring property to a trust, provided the trust's creator also serves as the trustee. This requires a written declaration of trust by the property owner. Additionally, assets, including real estate, can be assigned to your trust using asset assignment ledgers in an eStatePlan Funding Kit. If the real estate is owned through an LLC, you would assign your membership interest in the LLC to the trust, not the property itself.

Yes, cemetery plots can typically be included in a trust as part of estate planning. This allows for clear management and preservation of those assets. When establishing such a trust, it is essential to ensure that the legal requirements for trusts in your state are met, which may involve specific documentation and formalities. Consulting with a legal expert in estate planning is advisable to ensure compliance with applicable laws.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

As mentioned, some states have applied the same rules to IRAs. * IRC §401(a)(13)(A) provides that “a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated”. * The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) more clearly defines the rule stating that an anti-alienation clause(s) must be included in the retirement plan for it to be valid as a qualified plan, viz: “[A] trust will not be qualified unless the plan of which the trust is a part of provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be anticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, or subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process” (Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)-13(b)[1]). Inherited IRAs payable to a trust can enjoy certain asset protection benefits that may not have applied to the IRA owner. However, if a beneficiary has a right to receive an outright distribution from a trust then that particular distribution value (whether withdrawn or not) would be available to satisfy a creditor claim. The asset protection part comes into play by virtue of the trustee holding assets in trust because the language of the trust mandates it that way and not because the beneficiary simply directs the trustee not to distribute to him.

- **Question:** Off-Shore Asset Protection
- **Answer:** Any treatise on asset protection should make mention of off-shore trusts. When set up properly and prudently, off-shore trusts can provide a powerful method of asset protection for the right kind of circumstances. When introducing his co-authored book, “Lawsuit Lottery: The Hacking of Justice in America”, Douglass Lodmell succinctly opined the greater problem: “With more than a million lawyers and 70,000 lawsuits filed every day, the U.S. civil justice system has been corrupted into a gigantic get-rich-quick lottery! The new national pastime is played 20 million times a year by a growing army of self-styled "victims" and their increasingly powerful and predatory attorneys.” 4 The main premise of using off-shore trusts is the logic of getting one’s wealth entirely out of reach from the growing corruption within America’s legal system. When a controversy arises with a domestic asset protection plan involved, there obviously needs to be a form of justice received from the domestic court by the creator of the asset protection plan in order for it to stand up to the test and actually work. Off-shore trusts do not fall under the jurisdiction of any American court and thereby cannot be judged by a domestic court of law. That said, the “intent of the action” with respect to using an off-shore jurisdiction to control the fate of one’s assets in the event of a future lawsuit has itself been challenged in domestic court. Without question, establishing a viable off-shore trust structure brings with it a new set of challenges howbeit correspondingly rewarding one with arguably the ultimate level of asset protection. I have not ever been directly involved in the creation of an off-shore trust, but I have observed, researched, and studied up close. My takeaway is that any such endeavor to establish an off-shore trust should be embarked upon with cautionary due diligence and then only with the direct assistance of experienced, seasoned, and well-connected providers.

Good morning,

To update your trust, please log into your Advisor Console. Navigate to 'Dynamic Trust Portfolio/EP,' click 'View' to access client files, and select the specific client by clicking the 'Console' link. From there, go to Membership Status, access the BankCard Update Page to update the credit card, then click 'Update Account.' Finally, return to the Status page and go to (Re)Activation/Payment Page to complete the renewal process. With an active MLCP Membership, any updates can be recorded 24/7.

To add new beneficiaries to your trust, you typically need to amend the trust document itself. This usually involves creating a formal amendment that outlines the changes, including the addition of new beneficiaries. Ensure that the amendment is properly signed and notarized according to your state laws to make it legally binding. I recommend consulting with an estate planning attorney to ensure that all requirements are met and that the amendment aligns with your overall estate planning goals.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

A pour-over will acts as a mechanism to transfer assets that were not included in a Revocable Living Trust at the time of death. These assets go through probate and are then transferred (“poured over”) into the trust, ensuring they are distributed according to the trust's terms. This is particularly useful for items without account numbers, like jewelry, which can be conveyed using an 'Assignment of Personal Property' document. It's recommended to specify recipients for such items via a PostScript Page.

A pour-over will protects trust assets by directing that any assets left outside the trust at death are to be probated and subsequently "poured" into the trust. These assets are then distributed according to the trust's terms. For items without account numbers, such as jewelry, they are conveyed via the 'Assignment of Personal Property' document, and the PostScript Page can be used to specify recipients for those items.

- **Question:** POD/TOD Plans Avoid Estate Settlement Problems... Right?
- **Answer:** POD & TOD arrangements are the same in their singular function, which is to avoid probate of withdrawal-type accounts. POD accounts (also known as Totten Trusts) are generally offered through banks, and TOD accounts are available through most investment institutions. Such institutional account arrangements are generally easy to create where the account owner names a beneficiary(s) to take title of an identified account upon his decease, and thus probate of that account can be avoided. So, what could possibly go wrong? First, it should be understood that financial institutions provide these type of services only and entirely as a front-end incentive to draw and keep clientele. Such institutions are not helping to establish any kind of a purposed-design estate plan in the client’s best interests, nor can they. Secondly, these arrangements can “grow old” where an ever- increasing length of time since the POD/TOD origination can become a factor causing the custodial institution reluctance toward releasing funds outright to a beneficiary without additional, reasonable proof or due diligence of the deceased/owner’s intent. In addition, institutions offering probate-avoidance features do not disclose to the account owner that with such arrangements, alternate sets of potential circumstances are automatically created that might lead to unforeseen, unwanted, and even costly outcomes upon the account owner’s decease.

- **Question:** Best Practices for DPAOA planning.
- **Answer:** Considering what would be the proper way to offer and design DPAOA planning and documentation for clients, the path is quite clear. When implementing a Revocable Living Trust estate plan, the creator should also establish a DPAOA document and a Last Will & Testament (Pour-over Will) to work in conjunction with the RLT. When drafted properly, that means the DPAOA that serves as an ancillary document to the RLT estate plan would ALWAYS provide the DPAOA agent with the power and authority to transfer any of the principal’s (not-previously-assigned-to-the-trust) assets to the trustee of the creator/principal’s trust. That is always the case with our eStatePlan Portfolio DPAOA document. That way, the incapacitated client will always be able to have the trustee of his eStatePlan RLT administer personal assets on his behalf, as a trustee of his trust, if and when it becomes necessary to do so because of incapacitation.

- **Question:** Fundamentals of Asset Protection
- **Answer:** The logic of implementing asset protection strategies and proper estate planning designs go hand-in-hand for many asset owners. Those who are thoughtful enough to invest the time and expense to establish a proper estate plan to benefit their loved ones are often the same people who take a closer look at the feasibility of establishing a meaningful asset protection barrier to protect their family’s future. That is particularly so with assets owners who have the “low hanging fruit” such as substantial cash and/or brokerage accounts. With that in mind, we see a widespread misunderstanding concerning personal asset protection for creators of revocable living trusts. Although there are effective methods available to help significantly increase the privacy of living trust assets almost to the point of being hidden from public view, there is no inherent protective “wall of insulation” for assets held in a living trust that can be enjoyed by the creator during his lifetime. It’s a different story, however, for vested assets held IN TRUST – after the creator’s decease – for the (3rd party) beneficiaries of the trust.

- **Question:** Inherited IRAs Can Maintain Protection with a Trust
- **Answer:** Trusts created under a statutory “legal shield”, which protects against civil creditor judgments, serves as a “spendthrift trust”. Certain states recognize owned IRAs as spendthrift trusts while under custodial administration and will maintain that status throughout the IRA owner’s lifetime. Some states do not recognize spendthrift trust rules with IRA owner accounts. For other states, it depends on the total value of the IRA. The following pertains to ERISA type plans and not to federal government plans such as IRAs. As mentioned, some states have applied the same rules to IRAs. * IRC §401(a)(13)(A) provides that “a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated”. * The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) more clearly defines the rule stating that an anti-alienation clause(s) must be included in the retirement plan for it to be valid as a qualified plan, viz: “[A] trust will not be qualified unless the plan of which the trust is a part of provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be anticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, or subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process” (Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)-13(b)[1]). Inherited IRAs payable to a trust can enjoy certain asset protection benefits that may not have applied to the IRA owner. However, if a beneficiary has a right to receive an outright distribution from a trust then that particular distribution value (whether withdrawn or not) would be available to satisfy a creditor claim. The asset protection part comes into play by virtue of the trustee holding assets in trust because the language of the trust mandates it that way and not because the beneficiary simply directs the trustee not to distribute to him.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

A pour-over will acts as a mechanism to transfer assets that are left outside of a trust at the time of decease. These assets are probated and then transferred into the trust, where they are distributed according to the trust's terms. For items without account numbers, such as jewelry, you would use an 'Assignment of Personal Property' document to convey these items. Additionally, when creating a Revocable Living Trust estate plan, a Last Will & Testament (pour-over will) should also be established to work alongside the trust.

A pour-over will functions by allowing assets left outside the trust at the time of death to be probated first and then transferred (poured) into the trust. This ensures that these assets are subsequently distributed according to the terms of the trust. Items without account numbers, such as jewelry, are handled through an 'Assignment of Personal Property' document, allowing you to specify recipients for those items on the PostScript Page.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Answer:** Your LW&T acts as a pour-over will for assets left outside the trust at decease. Such assets are probated and then poured into the trust and distributed per its terms. Items without account numbers (e.g., jewelry) are conveyed via the 'Assignment of Personal Property' document. Use the PostScript Page to specify recipients for such items.

- **Question:** POD/TOD Plans Avoid Estate Settlement Problems... Right?
- **Answer:** POD & TOD arrangements are the same in their singular function, which is to avoid probate of withdrawal-type accounts. POD accounts (also known as Totten Trusts) are generally offered through banks, and TOD accounts are available through most investment institutions. Such institutional account arrangements are generally easy to create where the account owner names a beneficiary(s) to take title of an identified account upon his decease, and thus probate of that account can be avoided. So, what could possibly go wrong? First, it should be understood that financial institutions provide these type of services only and entirely as a front-end incentive to draw and keep clientele. Such institutions are not helping to establish any kind of a purposed-design estate plan in the client’s best interests, nor can they. Secondly, these arrangements can “grow old” where an ever- increasing length of time since the POD/TOD origination can become a factor causing the custodial institution reluctance toward releasing funds outright to a beneficiary without additional, reasonable proof or due diligence of the deceased/owner’s intent. In addition, institutions offering probate-avoidance features do not disclose to the account owner that with such arrangements, alternate sets of potential circumstances are automatically created that might lead to unforeseen, unwanted, and even costly outcomes upon the account owner’s decease.

- **Question:** Best Practices for DPAOA planning.
- **Answer:** Considering what would be the proper way to offer and design DPAOA planning and documentation for clients, the path is quite clear. When implementing a Revocable Living Trust estate plan, the creator should also establish a DPAOA document and a Last Will & Testament (Pour-over Will) to work in conjunction with the RLT. When drafted properly, that means the DPAOA that serves as an ancillary document to the RLT estate plan would ALWAYS provide the DPAOA agent with the power and authority to transfer any of the principal’s (not-previously-assigned-to-the-trust) assets to the trustee of the creator/principal’s trust. That is always the case with our eStatePlan Portfolio DPAOA document. That way, the incapacitated client will always be able to have the trustee of his eStatePlan RLT administer personal assets on his behalf, as a trustee of his trust, if and when it becomes necessary to do so because of incapacitation.

- **Question:** Fundamentals of Asset Protection
- **Answer:** The logic of implementing asset protection strategies and proper estate planning designs go hand-in-hand for many asset owners. Those who are thoughtful enough to invest the time and expense to establish a proper estate plan to benefit their loved ones are often the same people who take a closer look at the feasibility of establishing a meaningful asset protection barrier to protect their family’s future. That is particularly so with assets owners who have the “low hanging fruit” such as substantial cash and/or brokerage accounts. With that in mind, we see a widespread misunderstanding concerning personal asset protection for creators of revocable living trusts. Although there are effective methods available to help significantly increase the privacy of living trust assets almost to the point of being hidden from public view, there is no inherent protective “wall of insulation” for assets held in a living trust that can be enjoyed by the creator during his lifetime. It’s a different story, however, for vested assets held IN TRUST – after the creator’s decease – for the (3rd party) beneficiaries of the trust.

- **Question:** Inherited IRAs Can Maintain Protection with a Trust
- **Answer:** Trusts created under a statutory “legal shield”, which protects against civil creditor judgments, serves as a “spendthrift trust”. Certain states recognize owned IRAs as spendthrift trusts while under custodial administration and will maintain that status throughout the IRA owner’s lifetime. Some states do not recognize spendthrift trust rules with IRA owner accounts. For other states, it depends on the total value of the IRA. The following pertains to ERISA type plans and not to federal government plans such as IRAs. As mentioned, some states have applied the same rules to IRAs. * IRC §401(a)(13)(A) provides that “a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated”. * The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) more clearly defines the rule stating that an anti-alienation clause(s) must be included in the retirement plan for it to be valid as a qualified plan, viz: “[A] trust will not be qualified unless the plan of which the trust is a part of provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be anticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), alienated, or subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process” (Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)-13(b)[1]). Inherited IRAs payable to a trust can enjoy certain asset protection benefits that may not have applied to the IRA owner. However, if a beneficiary has a right to receive an outright distribution from a trust then that particular distribution value (whether withdrawn or not) would be available to satisfy a creditor claim. The asset protection part comes into play by virtue of the trustee holding assets in trust because the language of the trust mandates it that way and not because the beneficiary simply directs the trustee not to distribute to him.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

A pour-over will functions as a mechanism in estate planning where assets not included in a trust at the time of death are transferred into the trust through the probate process. Specifically, when the individual who created the trust passes away, those assets are probated and then "poured over" into the trust, where they are then distributed according to the trust's terms. This includes items without account numbers, like jewelry, which can be handled with an 'Assignment of Personal Property' document. It's advisable to use a PostScript Page to specify recipients for such items.

This ensures that assets left outside the trust are still managed according to your wishes. Items without account numbers, such as jewelry, are also handled through an 'Assignment of Personal Property' document. To specify recipients for these items, use the PostScript Page of your will.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Answer:** ## Notice of Privacy Policy ### Commitment to Privacy and Data Security Integrated Trust Systems / ITS Alliance Partners, LLC recognizes all end-user client rights to privacy. We are committed to the highest standards of data encryption technology by utilizing Turbo SSL (TM) – Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software – to keep client database records protected and secure. The exclusion of access to personal client records from unauthorized persons is as important to us as it is to you. IN ADDITION, we have installed advanced cyber security/penetration testing procedures and safety requirements to help maintain the integrity and permanency of client data: ### Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing ITS incorporated JURINNOV cybersecurity penetration, vulnerability, and data- breach response testing services over a period of several consecutive months. JURINNOV services provided proactive, compliant, vigilant and responsive approaches to protecting and securing data by helping to balance the risks associated with the transmission, storage, processing and external access to cloud- based information. JURINNOV (post-test) tracking reports created recommended solutions, when necessary, which were then monitored in succeeding, conclusive tests. The security metrics incorporated into the ITS platform ranked in the top 3% of all JURINNOV'S corporate clients at the conclusion of the testing series. ### PCI Data Security Standards Compliance ITS is in compliance with the safety requirements set by the Payment Card Industry's (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS) that are designed to ensure that the processing, storing, and transmitting of credit card information is done in a safe and secure environment. For your review, we also provide public disclosure to our responses on an industry-standard Vendor Cybersecurity Questionnaire. ### Client Information Practices Furthermore, in exercising the proper methods of gathering, maintaining, and using client information, we adhere to the following practices: * We collect, record and transfer information only as is necessary to enable our Internet service platform to provide end-user clients with the personal experience they need to help reach their respective estate planning goals. * Services requiring data-exchanges between affiliated parties may be necessary to analyze, edit, and submit personal data by personal advisors and legal counsel – or other appropriate sources – for the proper creation, funding, and implementation of prescribed estate plans. However, client files will not be transferred or made available to any other organization not authorized or otherwise connected by a service and/or marketing relationship to our processing network. * Any networking party associated with our Internet Platform Protocol sending or receiving personal client data must agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy Notice(s) prohibiting electronic files to be used for any other reason other than to coordinate and establish end-user client estate plans. Notwithstanding, we do not monitor related party activities beyond our data-exchange protocol requirements. * Through pre-arranged contractual agreements, clients and their family members (of the client's choice) may have access to personal information, through Client Consoles, electronically stored on our database, which also may be sent to us from other related sources. In any event, all personal information will be used only to accomplish the desired end result(s) for which purchases of our services have been made. ### Government Oversight and Attorney General Login As with any industry (especially those utilizing sophisticated data-exchange systems), our company and service platform may be subject to internal due diligence investigations by authorized governmental agencies. To facilitate any such investigative requests, we have created an Attorney General Login (AGL) page. The AGL page allows Attorney General Offices, in any state, Internet access (after provided with a secure database password) to view and analyze all pertinent client data-exchange occurrences and protocol activity between related service parties.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Selling a house in trust in California can trigger tax implications, especially following the California Supreme Court ruling in Carmack v. Reynolds, which expanded the reach of bankruptcy trustees over trust distributions not tied to health, education, maintenance, or support. Additionally, the Estate of Heggstad case clarified that no separate deed is required to transfer property to a trust if the grantor serves as the trustee. This ruling means planning around your trust and its implications becomes crucial. For specific guidance tailored to your situation, consulting a tax professional or estate planner is recommended.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

- **Question:** A Caveat: California Supreme Court Ruling – Carmack v. Reynolds (2017)
- **Answer:** A caveat is in play, however, that should have the attention of all IRA owners' who want to apply a level of control after their decease. The California Supreme Court recently decided (Carmack V. Reynolds > 2017) to expand the capabilities of a bankruptcy trustee to reach spendthrift trust distributions – at least to the extent that the distributions were not for health, education, maintenance & support (HEMS) purposes. While that case involved a bankruptcy trustee as the plaintiff and not some type of frivolous action, it is still to be noted. As of this writing, the recent majority of California State Legislators have amazingly dismantled much customary/common law for Californians; so that particular case is not a surprise. At any rate, now comes Nevada!

#### Source 2

- **Question:** Tax Considerations
- **Answer:** The original intent of irrevocable trusts is to remove the corpus of the trust from the taxable estate of the transferor; transfer tax laws turn on this concept. A gift, whether to an individual or to a qualified irrevocable trust, is valued as to its full market value on the date of the gift. This full market value is used in determining if the gift can be sheltered under the annual exclusion and/or if the federal unified credit should be taken against the transfer tax incurred at the time of transfer. Notwithstanding, any such completed gift, as described above, shall "pass through" the original basis of the donor to the donee. That means that if the donee sells the property, his capital gains tax liability (if any) will be calculated on the gain determined by subtracting the basis of the property of the original donor from the appreciated basis of the property at the time of sale by the donee.If a transfer can be revoked by the transferor or anyone in conjunction with the transferor who is not an adverse party to the revocation, or if the transferor retains a right to the income of the transferred property, then no completed gift has occurred (IRC #674 / Treasury Reg. #25.2511-2). In such case, the value of the property will be in the transferor's estate for transfer tax purposes and thus be "stepped-up" at the date of the transferor's decease. This scenario provides an interesting tax planning tool for the average family estate with appreciated property.

- **Question:** Key Considerations for Completing Estate Settlement
- **Answer:** * Paperless Transitions. It is recommended that to utilize the online access features provided through the Trustee/Executor Login page in conjunction with the transfer agents you are dealing with to help make the transfer actions a "paperless" event. The utilization of paperless transitions as much as possible can save time when settling the estate. * Estate Tax Liabilities. Rules governing federal and state estate (and inheritance) taxes regularly change; so it is recommended that you contact professional counsel if you have related questions since you can be held liable as the trustee/executor for any unpaid federal and/or estate taxes that may be due. Also, realize that certain state revenue departments may require a tax-report affidavit to be submitted by the trustee or executor within a certain time frame of the grantor/testator's decease. * When Probate is Needed. If the deceased grantor failed to assign all personal assets to the trust (or make payable to the trust), and that particular asset was not held in a Joint-Tenants- with-Right-of-Survivorship (JTWROS) format, then probate will likely be required of that asset. In such case, you will need to arrange for probate proceedings to have the court to first "prove the will" and then to transfer the (non-funded-to-trust) asset to you as the executor of the testator's will. Professional assistance is recommended. * Federal Income Reporting Elections/Filings. 26 USC §645 allows the trustee of a deceased grantor's revocable living trust to classify the trust as a "qualified revocable trust" – so as to file the trust estate income tax return as if it were the decedent's personal estate – if the trust estate is to be "wrapped up" within two years from the grantor's decease. That may be advantageous since personal estates may use a "fiscal" (instead of calendar) year, which begins at the date of decease, for reporting purposes. Also, a 1041 fiduciary return will not be required if the trust/estate generated less than $600 of "gross income" for the fiscal year. In such case, it would not then be necessary to apply for a federal EIN (tax ID) since the reporting of earned income for the fiscal year, if under $600, would not be required. * Estate Settlement Center. A comprehensive Estate Settlement Package, which is available exclusively through the Client Console, can further help to facilitate both the estate settlement and wrap up process. If it was not acquired by the client, it can be purchased by the trustee through the Trustee/Executor Login portal. * SEEK HELP WHEN NEEDED. Depending on the circumstances, an estate settlement can be a challenging and even daunting process. Personally-committed (although innocent) settlement errors and omissions can carry personal liability. If you have been appointed as the Successor Trustee but do not feel adequate or qualified to perform the duties then seek professional help. If you are concerned, don't hesitate to employ a law office or a trust company to help you do what they're trained to do.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Good afternoon,

Selling a house in a trust in California may carry tax implications influenced by various factors. One significant factor is the California Supreme Court ruling in Carmack v. Reynolds (2017), which expanded the authority of bankruptcy trustees regarding spendthrift trust distributions, particularly concerning how these distributions are treated under the law. Additionally, there are considerations regarding whether a formal deed is necessary for transferring property to a trust, as clarified in the Estate of Heggstad (1993).

It's advisable to consult a tax professional or attorney for personalized guidance on your specific situation.

I hope this information is helpful! Have a great day!

Good afternoon,

The tax implications of selling a house held in a trust in California can vary based on several factors, including the type of trust. Generally, if the trust is irrevocable, any gains from the sale may be taxed at the trust's tax rate. In the case of a revocable trust, proceeds may be taxed as personal income. It's also crucial to consider the California Supreme Court ruling in Carmack v. Reynolds, which affects the reach of bankruptcy trustees over trust distributions. Consulting a tax professional is advisable to navigate the specifics related to your individual circumstances.
