# Historical Context Learning System Testing Report

**Testing Date:** October 11-14, 2025
**Tester:** alex (user_id: 7)
**System Version:** Post Historical Context Changes
**Documentation:** Document_for_Historical_Context_Changes.txt

---

## 1. Testing Objectives

Per the "Document_for_Historical_Context_Changes.txt", test the following:

### 1.1. Historical Context Learning Mechanisms

- **edited_answer** - manually corrected answers
- **feedback** - user text feedback/notes
- **feedback_doc** - attachment of documents from the catalog

### 1.2. Mechanism Behavior

Per specification:
- "If feedback documents are found → The response should be generated from the feedback documents."
- "If an edited answer is found → The response should prioritize the edited answer."
- "If feedback is found → The response should be modified according to the previous feedback."

### 1.3. Additional Functions

- **Response modifier** - removal of greetings/signatures
- **question_index** - storage of question embeddings

### 1.4. Semantic Search

- **Similarity threshold:** 0.6
- Search for similar questions in question_index
- Retrieval of Historical Context from MySQL

---

## 2. Testing Methodology

### 2.1. Test Topic Selection

Tested 6 different topics:

- **TC-HC1:** Nevada Trustee Requirements (interactions 509-518)
- **TC-HC2:** Cancel Membership Billing (int 521, 524-526)
- **TC-HC3:** Trust Amendment Process (int 522, 527-528)
- **TC-HC4:** Client Console Access (int 523, 529)
- **TC-HC5:** Naming Trust as Beneficiary (int 549-550, 553-554)
- **TC-HC6:** Successor Trustee Appointment (int 555-556)

### 2.2. Testing Approaches

Two approaches were used:

**A. Isolated Testing** (mechanism works separately):
- Create baseline interaction without Historical Context
- Add ONLY one mechanism (edited_answer OR feedback OR feedback_doc)
- Ask similar question
- Check for mechanism markers in response

**B. Combined Testing** (multiple mechanisms together):
- Create interaction with multiple mechanisms
- Ask similar question
- Check which mechanism is used in response
- Assess actual behavior when combined

### 2.3. Marker Verification Methodology

Unique markers used for each mechanism:
- **Codes:** NV-QA-TEST-777, CANCEL-QA-TEST-888, EDIT-BENEFICIARY-QA-777
- **Email addresses:** nevada-test-cert@example.com, billing-cancel-qa@example.com
- **Phone numbers:** 1-888-CANCEL-NOW, 1-800-NV-TRUST
- **Time intervals:** 14 business hours, 48 business hours, 72 business hours
- **Specific phrases:** BLUE FORM CERTIFICATION, GOLD SEAL APPROVAL

**Verification:**
- grep search for markers in JSON response
- Check absence of markers in source_documents
- Count found markers / total markers

### 2.4. Test Isolation Requirements

For a proper isolated test:
- ✓ edited_answer = null
- ✓ feedback = null
- ✓ feedback_doc = null (for other mechanisms)
- ✓ Topic does NOT overlap with previous tests
- ✓ Semantic search finds exactly the tested interaction

**Isolation verification:**
- GET /api/interactions/{id} → verify other mechanisms = null
- Check sources in response: interaction_id or doc_id
- interaction_id in sources = semantic search triggered
- doc_id in sources = standard RRF, NOT Historical Context

## 4. Test TC-HC5: Naming Trust as Beneficiary (Isolated)

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Topic:** Naming trust as beneficiary (new topic for isolation)
**Interactions:** 549-550, 553-554

### 4.1. TC-HC5.1: feedback_doc ISOLATED (int 549→550)

**OBJECTIVE:** Proper isolated test of feedback_doc

**Baseline (int 549):**
- Question: "How do I name my trust as beneficiary on my accounts?"
- Status: answered

**Added ONLY feedback_doc:**
- {"name": "NAMING MY TRUST AS THE BENEFICIARY"}

**Isolation:**
- ✓ edited_answer: null
- ✓ feedback: null
- ✓ New topic (doesn't overlap with previous tests)

**Storage verification (GET /api/interactions/549):**
- ✓ feedback_doc: {"name": "NAMING MY TRUST AS THE BENEFICIARY"}
- ✓ edited_answer: null
- ✓ feedback: null

**Document from catalog (index260.json):**
- Name: "NAMING MY TRUST AS THE BENEFICIARY"
- Doc ID: from qa_index

**Unique phrases (markers for verification):**
1. "Request for New Beneficiary Appointment form"
2. "Data Exchange → Account Transfer → page 4"
3. "Funding Kit page"
4. "COT button"
5. "Certificate of Trust / Duplicate"

**Relevance:** 100% (document DIRECTLY answers the question)

**Test question (int 550):** "How do I name my trust as beneficiary on accounts?"

**Result:**
- Status: answered
- sources: ["98uQ75gB2vI2W7ZiyvOa"] ← NOT null

**✓ PROOF:** sources NOT null → semantic search FOUND interaction 549
**✓ PROOF:** Historical Context mechanism TRIGGERED

**Checking for feedback_doc markers:**
- ✗ "Request for New Beneficiary Appointment form"
- ✗ "Data Exchange → Account Transfer → page 4"
- ✗ "Funding Kit page"
- ✗ "COT button"
- ✗ "Certificate of Trust / Duplicate"

**Result:** 0/5 = 0%

**Checking source_documents:**
- Document "NAMING MY TRUST AS THE BENEFICIARY" is absent
- System used standard RRF search

**Chain of evidence:**
1. ✓ feedback_doc saved in MySQL
2. ✓ feedback_doc relevant to question (100%)
3. ✓ Semantic search found interaction 549 (sources not null)
4. ✗ feedback_doc NOT included in source_documents
5. ✗ feedback_doc content NOT used in answer

**Conclusion:** ❌ feedback_doc COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL
- Problem is NOT in retrieval (semantic search works)
- Problem is NOT in relevance (document 100% relevant)
- Problem is IN IMPLEMENTATION - agent ignores feedback_doc

---

### 4.2. TC-HC5.2: feedback WITH feedback_doc (int 549→553)

**OBJECTIVE:** Check if feedback works when feedback_doc is present

**State of int 549:**
- feedback_doc: {"name": "NAMING MY TRUST AS THE BENEFICIARY"}
- edited_answer: null
- feedback: null (before test)

**Added feedback with 5 unique markers:**
1. BENEFICIARY-QA-TEST-2025
2. 48 business hours
3. 1-888-BENEFICIARY-HELP
4. TRUST-BENEFICIARY-FORM-888
5. beneficiary-update-qa@example.com

**Test question (int 553):** "How can I name my trust as beneficiary on my accounts?"

**Result:**
- Status: answered
- sources: ["BMuR75gB2vI2W7ZiG_Rw"] ← interaction_id int 549

**Checking feedback markers:**
- ✓ BENEFICIARY-QA-TEST-2025
- ✓ 48 business hours
- ✓ 1-888-BENEFICIARY-HELP
- ✓ TRUST-BENEFICIARY-FORM-888
- ✓ beneficiary-update-qa@example.com

**Result:** 5/5 = 100%

**Checking feedback_doc:**
- ✗ "Funding Kit page"
- ✗ "Request for New Beneficiary Appointment"

**Result:** 0/5 = 0%

**Conclusion:**
- ✅ feedback WORKS at 100% (even when feedback_doc is present)
- ❌ feedback_doc does NOT work (content not used)

---

### 4.3. TC-HC5.3: ALL THREE MECHANISMS (int 549→554)

**OBJECTIVE:** Check actual behavior when all three mechanisms are present

**State of int 549:**
- ✓ feedback_doc: {"name": "NAMING MY TRUST AS THE BENEFICIARY"}
- ✓ feedback: 5 unique markers
- ✓ edited_answer: 8 unique markers (added)

**edited_answer markers:**
1. EDIT-BENEFICIARY-QA-777
2. TRUST-CERT-VERIFICATION-888
3. 72 business hours
4. 1-800-EDITED-TRUST
5. edited-beneficiary-qa@example.com
6. EDIT-TRACK-2025-OCT

**Test question (int 554):** "How do I name my trust as beneficiary on accounts?"

**Result:**
- Status: answered
- sources: ["98uQ75gB2vI2W7ZiyvOa"] ← interaction_id int 549

**Checking edited_answer markers:**
- ✓ EDIT-BENEFICIARY-QA-777

- ✗ beneficiary-update-qa@example.com

**Result:** 0/5 = 0%

**Checking feedback_doc:**
- ✗ "Funding Kit page"
- ✗ "Request for New Beneficiary Appointment"

**Result:** 0/5 = 0%

**Conclusion:**
- ✅ edited_answer: DOMINATES (100%)
- ❌ feedback: SUPPRESSED (0%)
- ❌ feedback_doc: IGNORED (0%)

**Actual behavior:** edited_answer > feedback > feedback_doc

**NOTE:** The specification contains separate IF statements, not IF-ELSE-IF, so an explicit priority hierarchy is not defined. However, the documentation suggests that feedback_doc should be used for generating the answer, but in reality it is completely ignored.

## 5. Test TC-HC6: Successor Trustee (Full Content in MySQL)

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Topic:** Successor Trustee (new topic, doesn't overlap with previous)
**Interactions:** 555-556

### 5.1. TC-HC6.1: feedback_doc WITH FULL CONTENT (int 555→556)

**OBJECTIVE:** Check if feedback_doc works when full content is stored in MySQL

**Baseline (int 555):**
- Question: "How do I name a successor trustee for my trust?"
- Status: answered
- Sources: 3 documents (standard RRF)

**Added feedback_doc with FULL content:**
```json
{
  "name": "QA Test - Naming Successor Trustee Process 2025",
  "source": "qa_test_2025_successor",
  "content": "To name a successor trustee, follow these steps:
              1. Access the SUCCESSOR-TRUSTEE-PORTAL
              2. Submit form TRUSTEE-APPOINTMENT-2025
              3. Reference code: SUCCESSOR-TRUSTEE-QA-999
              4. Processing time: 96 business hours
              5. Contact: trustee-update-portal@example.com
              6. Hotline: 1-877-SUCCESSOR-TRUSTEE
              7. Verification: TRUSTEE-CERT-VERIFICATION-2025
              8. Status tracking: SUCCESSOR-APPROVED-QA"
}
```

**Isolation:**
- ✓ edited_answer: null
- ✓ feedback: null

**qa_index verification:**
- Before test: 261 documents
- After test: 261 documents
- ✓ Custom document did NOT enter qa_index (only in MySQL)

**Test question (int 556):** "How can I name a successor trustee for my trust?"

**Result:**
- Status: answered
- sources: ["98uQ75gB2vI2W7ZiyvOa", "AsuR75gB2vI2W7ZiD_QI"]
- ✓ sources NOT null → semantic search triggered

**source_documents (3 documents):**
- "The Operations of a Living Trust" (x2)
- "Applying the Certificate of Trust Abstract"

**Checking markers (7 unique):**
- ✗ SUCCESSOR-TRUSTEE-QA-999
- ✗ trustee-update-portal@example.com
- ✗ TRUSTEE-APPOINTMENT-2025
- ✗ TRUSTEE-CERT-VERIFICATION-2025
- ✗ 96 business hours
- ✗ 1-877-SUCCESSOR-TRUSTEE
- ✗ SUCCESSOR-APPROVED-QA

**Result:** 0/7 = 0%

**Conclusion:**
Even when feedback_doc contains FULL content in MySQL (not just name), the system does NOT READ the content field.

The system does NOT pass feedback_doc to the agent OR the agent ignores it completely and uses standard RRF instead of feedback_doc.

## 6. Tests TC-HC2, TC-HC3, TC-HC4: Cancel/Amendment/Console

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Interactions:** 521-529

**NOTE:** These tests contained a methodology error. Interactions with edited_answer were not deleted before adding feedback_doc, so semantic search found old interactions with edited_answer instead of new ones with feedback_doc. Results show that edited_answer works, but do NOT prove that feedback_doc doesn't work due to priority.

### 6.1. TC-HC2: Cancel Membership (int 521, 524-526)

**Topic:** Cancel membership billing

**edited_answer (int 521→524):**
- 5 unique markers
- Result: 5/5 = 100% ✅

**feedback with edited_answer present (int 521→525):**
- 5 unique feedback markers
- Result: 0/5 = 0% ❌
- edited_answer markers present

**feedback_doc + edited_answer + feedback (int 521→526):**
- All three mechanisms added
- Result: edited_answer dominates

**Conclusion:** edited_answer works, feedback is suppressed

---

### 6.2. TC-HC3: Trust Amendment (int 522, 527-528)

**Topic:** Electronic trust amendment

**edited_answer (int 522→527):**
- 6 unique markers
- Result: 6/6 = 100% ✅

**feedback_doc + edited_answer + feedback (int 522→528):**
- All three mechanisms added
- Result: edited_answer dominates (100%)
- feedback: 0%
- feedback_doc: 0%

**Conclusion:** edited_answer works, others are suppressed

---

### 6.3. TC-HC4: Client Console Access (int 523, 529)

**Topic:** Client console access and trust changes

**All three mechanisms (int 523→529):**
- edited_answer: Dominates
- feedback: 17% (partial penetration)
- feedback_doc: In sources, but not prioritized

**Conclusion:** edited_answer works, feedback partially present

---

## 7. Additional Functions (P0 Priority)

### 7.1. Response Modifier

**Objective:** Verify removal of greetings and signatures from responses

**Old data (before September 23, 2025):**
- Example: "Good afternoon,\n\n...The ITS website employs...\n\nI hope this information is helpful! Please let me know if you need any additional assistance. Have a great day!"

**New data (October 13, 2025):**
- Interaction 509: "A Nevada-based trustee is not required..."
- Interaction 511: "A Nevada-based trustee is not required..."
- Interaction 518: "When selecting a trustee in Nevada..."
- Interaction 521: "To cancel your membership subscription..."

**Pattern verification:**
- grep -i "good afternoon|hello|hi there" [interactions]
- Result: Not found

- grep -i "have a great day|i hope this helps" [interactions]
- Result: Not found

- grep -i "please let me know if|feel free to contact" [interactions]
- Result: Not found

**Result:** ✅ Success (100%)
Response modifier correctly removes greetings and signatures

### 8.2. Analysis of Actual Mechanism Behavior

#### 8.2.1. edited_answer

**Status:** ✅ Fully functional
**Success rate:** 100% in all tests
**Consistency:** Works identically for all topics

**Characteristics:**
- All markers reproduced exactly
- Dominates over other mechanisms
- Works consistently for any topic

#### 8.2.2. feedback

**Status:** ⚠️ Works partially
**Success rate:** 75-100% (isolated), 0-17% (with edited_answer)

**Behavior:**
- **Isolated (without edited_answer):** 75-100%
  - TC-HC1.2 (Nevada): 3/4 markers (75%)
  - TC-HC5.2 (Beneficiary): 5/5 markers (100%)

- **With edited_answer:** 0-17%
  - TC-HC2, TC-HC3, TC-HC5.3: 0%
  - TC-HC4: 17% (partial penetration)

**Conclusion:** feedback works when isolated but is suppressed when edited_answer is present

#### 8.2.3. feedback_doc

**Status:** ❌ Completely non-functional
**Success rate:** 0% in all tests
**Consistency:** 100% failure rate

**Evidence (proper isolated test TC-HC5.1):**
1. ✓ feedback_doc saved in MySQL
2. ✓ feedback_doc relevant to question (100%)
3. ✓ Semantic search found interaction (sources not null)
4. ✗ feedback_doc NOT included in source_documents
5. ✗ feedback_doc content NOT used in answer

**Problems:**
- Problem is NOT in retrieval (semantic search finds interaction)
- Problem is NOT in relevance (document 100% relevant)
- Problem is NOT in priority (no competition with edited_answer)
- Problem is probably IN IMPLEMENTATION - agent ignores feedback_doc

**Additional findings:**
- Even with full content in MySQL - does NOT work (TC-HC6.1: 0/7)
- System does NOT read the content field from feedback_doc
- Agent uses standard RRF instead of feedback_doc

---

### 8.3. Actual Behavior When Combined

**Test TC-HC5.3 (all three mechanisms present):**
- feedback_doc: 0% usage
- edited_answer: 100% dominates
- feedback: 0% suppressed

**Actual order of usage:** edited_answer > feedback > feedback_doc

**Specification (Document_for_Historical_Context_Changes.txt) states:**
- "If feedback documents are found → The response should be generated from the feedback documents."
- "If an edited answer is found → The response should prioritize the edited answer."
- "If feedback is found → The response should be modified according to the previous feedback."

**NOTE:** The specification contains separate IF statements (not IF-ELSE-IF), so an explicit priority hierarchy is not defined. However, the documentation suggests that feedback_doc should be used for generating the answer, but in reality it is completely ignored.

---

## 9. Conclusion

### 9.1. Overall System Assessment

**Functionality:** Partially functional

**Working correctly:**
- ✅ edited_answer (100% of all tests)
- ✅ Response modifier (100%)
- ✅ question_index infrastructure (100%)
- ✅ Semantic search (finds similar questions with threshold 0.6)

**Working partially:**
- ⚠️ feedback (75-100% isolated, 0-17% with edited_answer)

**Not working:**
- ❌ feedback_doc (0% in all tests, critical bug)



### 9.5. Test Data Cleanup TO BE COMLETED AFTER REPORTING!!!

**Created interactions:**
- 509-518: TC-HC1 (Nevada Trustee)
- 521-529: TC-HC2, TC-HC3, TC-HC4 (Cancel, Amendment, Console)
- 549-550: TC-HC5.1 (Beneficiary, feedback_doc isolated)
- 553-554: TC-HC5.2, TC-HC5.3 (Beneficiary, feedback and all 3)
- 555-556: TC-HC6.1 (Successor, full content)
- 559-560: Attempt to prove retrieval

**Total interactions:** ~52

**Key findings:**
- ✅ edited_answer: 100% functional
- ⚠️ feedback: 75-100% isolated, 0-17% with edited_answer
- ❌ feedback_doc: 0% critical bug, completely non-functional
