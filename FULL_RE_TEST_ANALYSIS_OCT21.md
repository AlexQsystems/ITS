- **Category:** Client & Trustee Access

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Clients can access the Client Console using their unique Client Console ID# and Trustee Password. If they do not have this information, they should contact the support office for assistance. Once logged in through the Trustee Login portal, clients can view and print all documents within the Client Console but cannot make edits. To navigate, they should use the left sidebar to find the Dyn/Trust Portfolio portal, click on it, and then select the Dynamic Trust Portfolio button to reach the Portfolio Index, which includes links to all relevant documents and strategic pages. For added functionality, clients have access to modify their documents, communicate with service providers, and manage their estate planning through various features provided in the Client Console.

To make changes to your trust once it has been created, you can utilize the DATA EXCHANGE > DATA ENTRY module to update your Custom Trust Directives. This allows you to reflect any new wishes for beneficiaries or other directives. It's vital to consult with your legal advisor or attorney to review any significant changes to ensure compliance and proper documentation. If you wish to amend beneficiary details, you can also refer to the Video Guide available in your Client Console. These guidelines ensure smooth management of your estate planning needs.

- **Question:** The Operations of a Living Trust
- **Answer:** In simple terms, a living trust is an agreement between the trustor, also called the settlor/grantor, and the trustee. The trustor transfers title of assets to the "office" of the trustee. That process can be accomplished by either the formal retitling and deeding of property to the settlor/trustee during his lifetime or by the informal assigning of assets process. The (successor) trustee can then manage and eventually distribute those assets on behalf of the beneficiaries of the trust. Remarkab...

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Clients can access the Client Console by using their unique Client Console ID# and Trustee Password. If they do not have these credentials, they should contact the support office for assistance. Once logged in, clients can view and print their documents but cannot edit them while in trustee mode. To navigate, they should scroll down the left side menu and click on the Dyn/Trust Portfolio portal, then proceed to the Dynamic Trust Portfolio section to find the Portfolio Index, which includes hyperlinks to all relevant documents. Clients initially receive 90-day free access to the Client Console, with the option to subscribe for continued access and additional features thereafter.

To make changes to a trust after it has been created, you can utilize the DATA EXCHANGE > DATA ENTRY module to update your trust directives. This allows you to amend beneficiary information or other instructions. It is advisable to consult with your legal advisor when making significant modifications to ensure all changes comply with legal requirements. In specific scenarios, such as adding assets or altering beneficiaries, you can follow prompts in the Client Console or use available guides. Some sections may allow direct edits; for example, you can view/edit trustee selections and draft provisions. For more detailed guidance, access the respective tools provided in your trust management portal.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Probate costs can vary significantly, sometimes reaching up to 5% of the gross estate value, according to statutory fees recognized by the court. For example, on a $1.5 million estate, this could translate to a probate fee of approximately $45,000 after debts are accounted for. In addition to these costs, the probate process can involve detailed paperwork, court fees, and can result in significant stress due to the lack of privacy, as probate is a public matter. Proper planning to avoid probate is often advised, irrespective of the estate size.

The duration of probate can vary significantly depending on various factors, including the complexity of the estate, the jurisdiction, and whether there are disputes among heirs. Typically, probate can take anywhere from a few months to several years. In simpler cases, it may be completed in around 6 months, while more complex cases can extend to 18 months or even longer, especially if litigation is involved or if the estate includes assets in multiple jurisdictions. It is essential to understand that the probate process involves detailed paperwork, hearings, asset appraisals, and potential attorney fees, complicating and prolonging the timeline. Proper planning can help avoid unnecessary delays and expenses associated with probate.

For example, in some states, statutory fees are recognized and accepted by the court to pay the administrating law firm from the accounts of the estate being probated up to 5% (and sometimes more) of the gross estate value. To put that in perspective, let’s reduce that to 3% using a $1.5m gross estate being transferred with a net transferable value of (say) only $1m – after debts are paid.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Probate can incur significant costs depending on the jurisdiction and the complexity of the estate. For instance, in several states, statutory fees can be as high as 5% of the gross estate's value. To illustrate, if the gross estate is valued at $1.5 million, the probate fee could reach $45,000 if calculated at 3%. Aside from these fees, probate entails other costs, including attorney fees, court filing fees, and appraisal costs, all of which contribute to the overall expense. Additionally, the probate process is public, which could result in privacy issues for the family of the decedent. To avoid these costs and complications, it's advisable to consider estate planning options that bypass probate.

The probate process can vary significantly in duration, typically ranging from several months to a few years, depending upon various factors. These factors include the complexity of the estate, required paperwork, formal hearings, asset appraisals, attorney involvement, and potential disputes among heirs. Courts may also have waiting periods for hearings, further extending the timeframe. If there are real estate assets involved that are located outside the decedent's home jurisdiction, it may introduce additional probate processes, known as ancillary probate, prolonging the timeline. Given these complexities, thorough planning is advisable to avoid delays and potential conflicts.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Probate can be quite costly, often incurring fees that can reach up to 5% or more of the gross estate value, depending on state regulations. For example, in a scenario with a gross estate of $1.5 million, a 3% fee would amount to $45,000 for probate. Beyond these fees, the process can also involve complex paperwork, attorney fees, court costs, asset appraisals, and potentially even litigation, leading to significant time and resource consumption. Additionally, privacy is relinquished during the probate process, as it is a matter of public record. This can add emotional stress for the decedent's family, making it vital to consider alternatives to probate through proper planning.

The duration of the probate process can vary widely depending on the complexity of the estate, state laws, and whether disputes arise. Typically, it can take anywhere from a few months to several years. Key factors influencing this time include the amount of paperwork required, formal hearings, asset appraisals, and potential litigation among heirs. In some cases, if real estate is involved in different jurisdictions, additional probate processes may be required, further extending the timeline. Given these inherent complexities, it is advisable for individuals to consider estate planning strategies to avoid probate altogether, regardless of their estate size.

- **Question:** Costs, Privacy, and Emotional Impact of Probate
- **Answer:** Probate can be quite costly. For example, in some states, statutory fees are recognized and accepted by the court to pay the administrating law firm from the accounts of the estate being probated up to 5% (and sometimes more) of the gross estate value. To put that in perspective, let’s reduce that to 3% using a $1.5m gross estate being transferred with a net transferable value of (say) only $1m – after debts are paid. That would incur a $45,000 probate fee! When faced with the potential prospect...

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Selling a house held in a trust in California can have various tax implications. When the property is sold, capital gains tax may be applicable based on the appreciation of the property since it was acquired. If the trust is a revocable trust, gains may be reported on the grantor's individual tax return. For irrevocable trusts, it is crucial to consider how distributions and income are taxed. Consult with a tax professional for specific advice tailored to your situation. It's also important to file a new Quit Claim Deed reflecting the new ownership after the sale.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Selling a house held in a trust in California can potentially lead to various tax implications, primarily concerning capital gains tax and property tax. As per California law, if the trust is revocable, the grantor is still considered the owner for tax purposes, and any capital gains taxes will apply to them personally upon sale. If the trust is irrevocable, the tax implications can differ, and it's essential to ascertain whether the trust itself is responsible for any taxes or if they pass to beneficiaries. A step-up in basis may apply upon the grantor's death, impacting the capital gains tax owed upon eventual sale. Additionally, clients should upload a new Quit Claim Deed post-sale and maintain updated records. Importantly, consulting with a tax professional for guidance tailored to specific situations is highly recommended.

- **Answer:** If one has property with notable appreciation, he likely would prefer that the basis of that property be stepped-up at the date of his death. Even though a decedent receives a stepped-up-in-basis at death, part of it will be taken back through estate taxes if the value of the stepped-up estate is in excess of the transfer tax exemption amounts. Nevertheless, if a completed gift is made, gift taxes may be due anyway because the value of the gift (and gift tax liabilities) for transfer tax purpose...

- **Question:** Does establishing a Nevada trust provide me, the creator of the trust, with any personal income and/or capital gains tax savings seeing that Nevada is an income-tax free state?
- **Answer:** No. The benefit of Nevada trust law with respect to having a ZERO state- income tax table generally applies to income created from assets held in a Nevada trust – after grantor’s decease – which have not been distributed outright but held IN TRUST for that calendar year and added to the principal. To that end, assets held in a Nevada trust are also excluded from state capital gains tax.

Because the transfer to this trust would be a completed gift, the principal of the trust will not be in the grantor's estate for transfer tax purposes. That estate tax avoidance strategy will always work regardless of: (i) the value that was transferred by gift, or (ii) the appreciation of the transferred property, and (iii) come what may in the ever-changin...

### Bot Answer (FULL)
The tax implications of selling a house held in a trust in California typically involve capital gains taxes. If the home appreciates in value, the seller may owe taxes on this appreciation unless the property qualifies for the primary residence exclusion. Additionally, if the trust is a revocable living trust, the gains are usually reported on the grantor's tax return. However, beneficiaries might face different treatment if they inherit the property. A step-up in basis could apply, potentially reducing tax liabilities. It is advisable to consult a tax professional for specific guidance tailored to your situation.

When establishing a Nevada revocable trust, it is not strictly necessary to have a Nevada-based trustee, as individuals from outside the state can be appointed as trustees. However, for practical purposes, especially concerning estate settlement, it is often recommended to appoint a Nevada trust company. This choice is entirely within your control. Therefore, while you can appoint individuals or entities not located in Nevada, having a Nevada-based trustee may simplify administration and compliance with state laws surrounding trusts.

You can appoint a family member or friend as a trustee even if they are not a resident of Nevada.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
A cemetery plot is generally considered real property for trust requirements. Under California law, property can be treated as transferred to a trust without a separate deed if the owner is the settlor and trustee. The Estate of Heggstad case confirms that as long as the statutory requirements are met, a written declaration can suffice to establish a trust that includes real property, such as a cemetery plot. Moreover, realty deeds, which transfer property, have specific validity requirements that do not necessarily require recording, meaning ownership can still be established without formal documentation.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
A cemetery plot is considered real property for trust requirements, as it falls under the definition of realty or real estate. In estate planning, it is important to comply with applicable statutes of fraud when transferring real property to a trust. A written declaration of trust can be used to effectuate this transfer without the need for a formal deed if the owner of the property is also the settlor and trustee of the trust. This principle is outlined in cases like the Estate of Heggstad, which illustrates how such transfers can legitimately occur without additional formalities. Therefore, cemetery plots can be included in the assets of a trust when properly documented.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
A cemetery plot is indeed considered real property in relation to trust requirements. Courts have clarified that real property can be included as part of a trust's assets without the need for a separate deed, provided specific conditions are met, such as the settlor being the owner of the property and serving as the trustee. Therefore, cemetery plots, being a type of real property, can be effectively transferred to a trust if these requirements are complied with. This inclusion supports estate planning by enabling proper management of burial interests.

To upload contracts and receipts to support your trust documentation, you can do so within the eVault system. While it is not strictly necessary to upload all supporting documents for your trust to be considered funded, it is crucial that the assets are effectively listed and assigned in the Funding Kit. This will ensure that your trust documentation is complete and meets the necessary requirements. If you have any specific instructions for uploading or need further guidance on this process, please refer directly to the resources provided by your trust administrator or legal advisor.

You do not need to upload all contracts and receipts to ensure that your trust is properly funded. The key requirement is to have the assets clearly listed and assigned within the Funding Kit. While it may be helpful for your documentation purposes, only essential documents that demonstrate the trust's existence and the authority of the trustee need to be provided, such as the Certificate of Trust. For additional support about where to upload documents, consider reaching out directly to your trust management service or consult their support resources for specific guidance on document submission processes.

After the grantor's death, the successor or executor typically gains access to login credentials through established processes outlined in the estate plan documentation. If the estate utilizes a digital management portal, such as The eStatePlan, the successor can access the necessary credentials via the Trustee/Executor Login. They can also obtain necessary forms and guides for estate settlement tasks, such as asset retitling. In cases where physical documentation is involved, the successor may need to follow specific steps, like providing a death certificate or any required identification, to authenticate their authority to access the materials.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
After the grantor dies, the successor or executor can gain login credentials through the estate management platform utilized by the grantor. They typically access the Trustee/Executor Login which allows them to open the Estate Settlement portal. This portal contains essential information and documents needed to manage the estate, including forms necessary for retitling assets. If a corporate trustee is involved, all documentation will be stored securely in the platform's cloud for easy access. It's crucial for the successor to identify any specific processes or passwords that were used by the grantor for quick access to these digital resources.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Heirs and beneficiaries typically receive their distributions after the completion of the probate process, which can vary in length depending on the complexity of the estate, jurisdiction, and whether any disputes arise. For trusts, distributions are made directly to beneficiaries once they reach the age specified in the trust, for example, age 21. If the trust or estate has conditions or specific timing factors (like performance of final estate taxes), that may also influence when distributions occur. It’s advisable to consult the estate executor or trust administrator for precise timing based on the specific circumstances.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Heirs and beneficiaries typically receive their distributions after the estate has been settled according to the terms of the will or trust, as well as state laws. Distribution generally occurs once all debts, taxes, and expenses of the estate are paid. In many cases, distributions are made outright to each named beneficiary who has attained the designated age, such as 21, if specified in a trust. If no clear beneficiaries are named, probate laws may default to state intestacy laws for distribution. For further clarity, it is advised to consult the legal documents and possibly an estate attorney to ensure proper adherence to the distribution process.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Heirs and beneficiaries typically receive their distributions when the estate has been settled or when the trust terms dictate. For instance, under certain trusts, distributions may be made outright to named beneficiaries who have attained the minimum age, often 21 years old. It's crucial to note that distributions can vary based on the specific stipulations outlined in the trust or will, and distributions related to an IRA may depend on whether a valid designated beneficiary is named. Therefore, specific circumstances including estate taxes and beneficiary qualifications can influence the timing of the inheritance distribution significantly.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Yes, real estate can indeed be placed in a trust. There is generally no need to retitle personal real estate property into the name of the trust. By listing the property in the Funding Kit and electronically signing the Ledger of Assigned Realty, it will be legally assigned to your trust, which facilitates the avoidance of probate upon your death. Additionally, any domestic assets, irrespective of their location, can be assigned to a trust, including real estate, as long as they are retitled or formally documented, thus becoming part of the trust's assets.

Cemetery plots can generally be placed in a trust. This allows for the management and control of the plot after your passing, ensuring that your wishes regarding its use are upheld and that the plot is preserved for your intended beneficiaries. Including cemetery plots in a trust can simplify the inheritance process and potentially avoid probate complications. It's crucial to consult with a legal expert familiar with estate planning to properly structure the trust and ensure compliance with applicable laws, as regulations may vary by state.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Yes, real estate can be placed in a trust. To effectively transfer real estate into a trust and avoid probate, you typically need to either retitle the property directly into the name of the trust or use a ledger of assigned realty. However, it's noted that a formal deed may not always be required if the trust creator is also the trustee, as indicated by the legal precedent in the Estate of Heggstad case. This means that a written declaration naming the property can serve as sufficient documentation without needing a formal deed. In any case, it's crucial to ensure compliance with relevant legal requirements and regulations pertaining to trusts and property transfers.

Cemetery plots can be placed in a trust, as they are considered a type of asset that can be transferred into a trust for estate planning purposes. Placing cemetery plots in a trust can help ensure that your wishes regarding burial and memorial arrangements are honored and can prevent disputes among family members after your passing. It is advisable to coordinate with legal professionals specializing in estate planning to ensure that the transfer is conducted according to your state’s laws and that the trust terms clearly outline your intentions regarding the cemetery plots.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Yes, real estate can be placed in a trust. A trust can hold any and all domestic assets, including real estate, regardless of their location, as long as these assets can be assigned or retitled to the trust. This has been established through legal precedents, such as the Estate of Heggstad case, which demonstrated that real property can be incorporated into a trust without the need for a separate deed if certain conditions are met, specifically when the owner of the property is also the trust's settlor and trustee.

Cemetery plots can indeed be placed in a trust, as they are often considered personal property. Including cemetery plots in a trust can help ensure that they are managed and transferred according to the wishes of the individual who established the trust. However, specific legal requirements or limitations may apply depending on the jurisdiction and the terms of the trust itself. It is advisable to consult a qualified estate planning attorney to navigate the specifics related to placing cemetery plots into a trust efficiently and legally.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
A successor trustee can access the Client Console after the original trustee's death by utilizing the Trustee/Executor Login. They will need the Client Console ID# and Trustee Password. If these credentials are unavailable, they should contact the trust office for assistance. Once logged in, the successor trustee will have access to the Estate Settlement portal, allowing them to view important documents and resources, such as the Estate Settlement Primer and Quick Reference Settlement Guide, to help retitle assets accordingly. Importantly, while logged in as a trustee, they can view and print documents but cannot make edits.

To gain access as a successor trustee, you will typically need several documents to ensure proper authority and transfer of responsibilities. Key documents may include a written statement of the Settlor's resignation, a medical certification if the Settlor is in capacity (often applicable in cases of incapacity), and the Successor Trustee Acceptance form. Upon the death of the Settlor, the successor trustee can utilize the Client Console to access the Estate Settlement portal for necessary guides on retitling assets. Utilizing cloud-based access may also facilitate retrieval of pertinent client information stored within the eStatePlan for ongoing management of the trust.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Beneficiaries typically receive distributions from a trust or estate upon meeting specific conditions set forth by the trust document, which often includes age requirements. For instance, distributions may be made outright to each named beneficiary upon reaching the age of 21, as outlined in the trust provisions. Additionally, if distributions are related to IRA accounts, the timing can depend on regulations such as those imposed by the SECURE Act, which details the qualifications for designated beneficiary trusts. It's essential to check the specific terms of the trust or estate in question to determine the exact timing of distributions.

The trust does not pay tax on distributions; rather, the beneficiaries are responsible for paying tax on the distributions they receive. Specifically, withdrawals from qualified accounts, such as IRAs, are typically taxed as ordinary income for the beneficiaries. When a trust receives distributions from these accounts, it's essential to allocate the income correctly per trust terms, often leading to reports like K-1s being issued to beneficiaries. For any distributions made to the trust from accounts like IRAs, it's crucial to consider both the income tax implications for the beneficiaries and any potential estate tax strategies.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
Beneficiaries typically receive distributions when they have attained the age specified in the trust documents. For example, distributions are commonly made outright to beneficiaries who have reached the age of 21, but this minimum age can be adjusted based on the trust’s directives. If specific terms regarding age and distribution are outlined in the trust, those stipulations will dictate when beneficiaries receive their inheritance. Additionally, if a trust is set up as a Designated Beneficiary Trust (DBT), it may influence how and when distributions occur in accordance with regulations such as the SECURE Act.

The trust does not pay tax on distributions from a qualified account, such as an IRA; instead, beneficiaries are responsible for paying tax on the distributions they receive. Withdrawals from these qualified accounts are generally taxed as ordinary income. When transferring a qualified account to a trust, tax is triggered unless specific conditions are met, such as designating the trust as the beneficiary. After the trustor's death, distributions to the trust are reported according to the trust's terms, typically via K-1 forms to the beneficiaries.

Beneficiaries receive distributions based on the terms set forth in the trust. Typically, distributions are made outright to each named beneficiary who has reached the age of 21, as prescribed in the trust document. If modifications are necessary, they can be made via the Custom Trust Directives table/text box on your Data Entry page. If there are specific mistrusts or conditions affecting the timing and manner of distributions, it’s essential to consult the governing documents or a legal expert.

For distributions from qualified accounts, such as IRAs, withdrawals are subject to federal income tax and are taxed as ordinary income. If the distribution is transferred directly to your trust using an IRA Administrative Trustee format, it can trigger tax unless managed appropriately. Otherwise, designating the trust as a beneficiary ensures distributions are treated according to the trust terms, with potential tax implications reported on forms like K-1s to beneficiaries. It's crucial to follow the proper procedures to minimize tax liabilities effectively.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
When putting a house in a trust, you do not need to create a new deed for the property. Instead, you can list the property in your Funding Kit and electronically sign the Ledger of Assigned Realty to legally assign it to your trust. However, if you are in Pennsylvania, you might consider using a quit claim deed (Residence Deed) to transfer the property into the trust, although it is not necessary to record the deed for the transfer to be valid. If the property were retitled to the trust prior, selling it would require you to act as the trustee rather than as a natural person.

When a house is placed in a trust, particularly a revocable one, it generally does not alter the property's property tax implications. The owner is still responsible for property taxes as before since the trust does not change the ownership for tax purposes. If the trust is irrevocable, property tax assessments might change based on the trust's terms and estate taxes could be implicated based on the value of the trust assets at the time of death. It's essential to consult with a tax advisor for specific implications based on state laws and regulations.

The trustor transfers title of assets to the "office" of the trustee.

The (successor) trustee can then manage and eventually distribute those assets on behalf of the beneficiaries of the trust. Remarkab...

- **Question:** Does establishing a Revocable Living Trust under Nevada law help avoid any estate- transfer-related taxation that may be imposed by my own state of domicile at the time of my decease?
- **Answer:** No. If you are then a citizen of one of the twelve states, or the District of Columbia, that (currently) impose transfer/estate taxes upon their citizens at the time of decease and/or one of the six states that (currently) impose transfer-related inheritance taxes upon their citizens at their decease then the same obligations, if any, shall be requisite upon your trust estate regardless of where it is sitused, including the State of Nevada.

- **Answer:** No. The benefit of Nevada trust law with respect to having a ZERO state- income tax table generally applies to income created from assets held in a Nevada trust – after grantor’s decease – which have not been distributed outright but held IN TRUST for that calendar year and added to the principal. To that end, assets held in a Nevada trust are also excluded from state capital gains tax.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
You do not need a new deed when putting your house in trust. It suffices to list the property in your Funding Kit and electronically sign the Ledger of Assigned Realty, legally assigning the property to your trust without altering the deed. However, if you wish to sell or transfer the property in the future, ensure the property is titled in the trust's name, which may require a new deed. This can include submitting a Quit Claim Deed depending on local law. Always consult with legal professionals if you have specific concerns about your situation.

When you place a house in a trust, particularly an irrevocable trust, the implications for property taxes can be significant. The original intent of such trusts is to remove the assets from the taxable estate of the grantor, potentially minimizing estate taxes. However, if the trust is revocable, the property may remain in the grantor's estate for tax purposes, resulting in a "stepped-up" basis at death, which can affect capital gains calculations upon sale. Additionally, local property taxes may not change solely because of the trust, but the assessment could be influenced based on how the trust is structured and the ownership transfer. It's essential to consult a tax professional to evaluate specific tax implications based on individual circumstances.

### Bot Answer (FULL)
No, there is no need to create a new deed when putting a house into a trust. Instead, by listing the property in your Funding Kit and electronically signing the Ledger of Assigned Realty, the property is legally assigned to your trust without the need for a deed change. This process allows the successor trustee to manage and distribute the asset without probate interference, as the property is effectively associated with the trust. However, if you wish to transfer the realty interests to beneficiaries or a third party, formal documentation such as a grantor deed may be required for recording purposes.

The implications for property taxes when a house is placed in a trust depend primarily on the type of trust established. For instance, a revocable living trust typically does not change how property taxes are assessed since the grantor remains the owner for tax purposes and can still be liable for property taxes. Additionally, placing a house in a trust may not protect it from estate or inheritance taxes, especially if the grantor resides in a state that imposes such taxes. It is crucial for the trust to be structured correctly to align with state laws. Consultation with a legal or tax professional is advisable for personalized advice.

A Pour Over Will is a type of will designed to ensure that any assets not already placed in a trust during a person's lifetime will be automatically transferred into that trust upon their death. This mechanism serves as a safety net, protecting those assets by funneling them into the trust, where they can be managed according to the terms set out in the trust document. Essentially, it provides a way to include all assets under the trust's umbrella, even if they were neglected during the individual's lifetime.

10. TC2.7 Run 3 (Int 685) - Pour-over Will: 0 sources, detailed response (completed_high_confidence)
11. TC6.1 Run 3 (Int 677) - Payment Card: 0 sources, detailed card renewal response
12. TC1.4 Run 3 (Int 675) - Cemetery Plot: 0 sources, hallucinated response

**Affected Tests**: 6 из 20 (30%)


### Confirmed Regressions from Baseline
1. **TC6.2** - Contracts/Receipts: 3/3 sources → 0 sources (100% regression)
2. **TC2.7** - Pour-over Will: 5/5 sources → 0 sources + special status

### Pre-existing Issues (Baseline Also Had, Not Detected Then)
1. **TC1.4** - Cemetery Plot: Baseline also hallucinated (sources didn't mention cemetery)
   - Baseline QA used "topical relevance" standard → missed the hallucination
   - Retest QA used "entity-specific relevance" standard → detected the hallucination
   - **System behavior unchanged**, only detection improved

### New Issues Discovered
1. **P1 Fallback Bug**: 20% of all runs (not in baseline)
2. **Cemetery plots hallucination**: Agent hallucination (TC1.4, TC2.1) - TC1.4 existed in baseline
3. **Property/estate tax conflation**: Agent hallucination (TC2.5, TC2.3)
4. **Inconsistent escalation**: Security risk (TC1.3)

### Improvements from Baseline
1. **False negatives fixed**: TC1.2, TC6.5 (now find sources)
2. **Source quality improved**: TC2.6 (dramatic improvement ⭐)
3. **Escalation logic improved**: TC1.5, TC3.1 (consistent)
4. **Information completeness**: TC2.4 (includes timeline)

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Response Time**: ~16.5s
- **Min**: 13s
- **Max**: 23s
- **p95**: ~21s
- **Timeouts**: 0

### What IMPROVED ✅

1. **False Negatives**: TC1.2, TC6.5 now find relevant sources
2. **Poor Source Selection**: TC2.6 now finds highly relevant sources (10/10)
3. **Incomplete Information**: TC2.4 now includes timeline (6-18 months)
4. **Hallucinations**: TC1.3 mostly escalates correctly (2/3 runs)
5. **Escalation Logic**: TC1.5 consistently escalates pricing questions
6. **Inconsistent Behavior**: TC3.1 now consistently escalates

### What DIDN'T IMPROVE ❌

1. **TC3.2**: Still answers specific tax consultations (should escalate)
2. **NEW Issue - TC1.3**: Introduced inconsistency (1/3 runs answered)

### What GOT WORSE ⚠️

1. **Fallback Bug**: NEW issue discovered (sources=0 but detailed answers)
   - Not present in baseline (baseline always escalated or found sources)
   - Critical production blocker

## RECOMMENDATIONS

  **Fallback Bug**: Investigate why system answers with sources=[]
   - Maybe we should check exception handlers in query pipeline? And ensure all errors result in escalation, not LLM fallback?

**Question** Why does the test TC2.7 get 'completed_high_confidence' status while other 0-source cases get completed?
